Smartphones, equipped with an array of sensors, have become valuable tools for personal sensing. Particularly in digital health,
smartphones facilitate the tracking of health-related behaviors and contexts, contributing significantly to digital phenotyping, a
process where data from digital interactions is analyzed to infer behaviors and assess mental health. Traditional methods process
raw sensor data into information features for statistical and machine learning analyses. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach
that systematically converts smartphone-collected data into structured, chronological narratives. The AWARE Narrator translates
quantitative smartphone sensing data into English language descriptions, forming comprehensive narratives of an individual’s activities.
We apply the framework to the data collected from university students over a week, demonstrating the potential of utilizing the
narratives to summarize individual behavior, and analyzing psychological states by leveraging large language models.

Introduction
The modern smartphone contains an array of sensors that enable the sensing and tracking of various phone states,
uses and properties. These sensors include accelerometer, GPS/geolocation, Bluetooth, communication logs (phone
and SMS), application usage and keyboard activity. Given their various sensors and the opportunities to utilise them,
smartphones, the Swiss army knives of digital technology, have proven to be valuable personal sensing devices, with
applications in domains such as health, education and leisure.
Given their potential to track various health-related behaviours and user contexts, as well as the emergence of health
apps, smartphone sensing has become a pivotal topic in digital health. This is particularly the case in digital mental
health, where the concept of digital phenotyping has emerged in recent years. In short, digital phenotyping espouses
the idea that the data created from our use of and interaction with digital technologies, such as smartphones, can be
mined or analysed to infer behaviours and, ultimately assess mental health [1, 2]. The focus of our work in this paper is
on leveraging smartphone sensing as a tool in psychology and mental health.
Once raw sensor data is collected, it is typically processed into information features that can be used in statistical
analyses and machine learning model construction. For instance, from raw geolocation data one, features such as
total distance travelled or time spent at the most visited location can be derived. In this paper, however, we propose
a novel approach to analyze smartphone sensing data. The core idea is to translate quantitative smartphone sensing

data records into corresponding descriptions in English (or other natural language), which could ultimately be used to
construct a narrative summary that describes an individual’s day (or other specified period).
The generation of sensing statements based on data from digital sensors, let alone modern smartphone sensors, has
received limited attention in the literature [6]. Beyond general interest, from our perspective the idea of translating
smartphone data records into English descriptions has a further motivation in recent times given the contemporary
influence of large language models (LLM) and the availability of systems such as OpenAI’s GPT models and Google’s
Gemini. Whilst one approach involves applying LLMs to tabular data for tasks such as description, prediction and
general quantitative reasoning [4], another promising avenue is to convert tabular smartphone data records into sets of
English statements. These statements could then be fed into LLMs to extract descriptive summaries, generate pattern
insights, or even explore the potential for LLMs to make inferences about mental health.
AWARE Narrator systematically and chronologically organizes smartphone-collected data into structured narratives.
In this study, we demonstrate the potential of consolidating multi-sensor smartphone data into sensing statements
that can be effectively utilized with LLMs. This approach shifts the behavioral analysis problem into the realm of
natural language processing. Compared to traditional analysis methodologies (e.g. basic data feature calculations), this
approach offers several benefits. First, by integrating data from a wide array of sensors, the sensing statements reveal
more information that might not be readily apparent through conventional analysis. Compared to raw quantitative
and categorical data, the sensing statements offer finer granularity and richer, human-readable information. Second,
this approach provides multi-dimensional information. Each entry point of the sensing statement encapsulates various
dimensions such as timeline, sensor type, and detailed target information collected (e.g. message/call contact names or
Bluetooth device names). Third, the sensing statements are designed to be interpretable by both humans and machines,
thereby enhancing transparency in data analysis. This dual interpretability may better facilitate communication and
collaboration between human analysts and automated systems.

AWARE Smartphone Sensing Data
To illustrate the core ideas of this paper and establish a framework for translating smartphone sensing data into English
sensing statements, we utilize the AWARE smartphone sensing platform, in particular, the AWARE-Light app variant
[9].
The AWARE platform is a versatile and powerful tool designed to harness the sensor capabilities of modern smart-
phones for both research and practical applications. By integrating a variety of sensors, such as accelerometers,
gyroscopes, GPS, and light sensors, AWARE enables the continuous and real-time collection of data related to physical
activities, environmental conditions, and user interactions. The data gathered from these sensors is stored in a MySQL
database, with each sensor’s data being stored into its own table. This structured data can then be analyzed and
interpreted to yield deep insights into user behavior and environmental contexts.
AWARE’s open-source nature, along with its robust API and plugin architecture, offers researchers and developers
significant flexibility to customize and extend its functionalities to suit specific needs. This adaptability makes AWARE
an invaluable resource across a wide range of disciplines, including health monitoring, smart environments, and urban
computing, thereby fostering innovation and collaboration within the global research community.
We will now list all the AWARE sensors included in our conversion framework and provide a description of the fields
associated with each sensor. It is important to note that, in addition to the specific fields detailed for each sensor, every
sensor table includes three standard columns: row id, timestamp, and device ID.

AWARE Narrator: Converting AWARE Tabular Data to Narratives
In this section, we outline the process of converting tabular data into descriptive sensing statements and utilizing
these sensing statements with large language models (LLMs). We begin by collecting smartphone sensor data through
AWARE-Light, which is then transformed into daily sensing statements using the AWARE Narrator framework1. These
daily sensing statements are subsequently summarized into weekly abstractions to gain psychological insights or
analyze behavioral patterns based on daily activities, as depicted in Figure 1.
3.1
Converting AWARE tabular data to descriptive rows
We have developed a Python script that extracts records from each of the tables mentioned in the previous section,
converts each record into an English description, and sorts all the descriptions in chronological order, from earliest to
latest. Each line of output is in the following format:

Note that for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi data, both detected and connected devices are recorded. Detected devices can
provide insights into how occupied a location is, while connected devices reflect the user’s active connection activity.
For battery data, rather than recording every change, we capture only the local minimum and maximum values. A
similar approach is applied to the keyboard sensor, where instead of logging each character typed, we focus on the core
content produced by the user, such as complete sentences, individual words, or paragraphs within a session.
Location data is processed using the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
algorithm, specifically employing agglomerative clustering with a 50-meter cluster diameter. The centroid of each
cluster is determined using either a manually developed map or the Google Maps API to provide specific location
information. Due to the reliance on cluster centroids, this method may result in inaccuracies when retrieving specific
location points. Users of the AWARE Narrator framework have the flexibility to adjust the clustering threshold as
needed.
The home location is identified based on the cluster containing the most nighttime data points, specifically filtered
to include only data between 20:00 and 04:00. Additionally, we calculate the distance from home and determine the
corresponding movement status based on recorded speed, defining four types of activity events: stopping (0 m/s),
walking (0-1 m/s), running (1-3 m/s), and riding vehicles (over 3 m/s).
For applications running in the foreground, the "System UI" application is excluded as it frequently appears but does
not contribute valuable information for analysis. Regarding application notifications, if the content is captured, it is
included in the description; otherwise, the description will simply state "Received a notification from <application>."
The same approach applies to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi data, where names are omitted if they are not detected.
For messages and calls, AWARE uniquely encrypts each contact’s phone number, ensuring privacy while still allowing
for the analysis of the number of different contacts and the frequency of communication with each.
The following data is a chronological list that describes the smartphone sensor events collected over a day from the smartphone of a university student.
The form of each data record is: timestamp | sensor | description. Answer the following question based on this data: {question}.
{data}
Fig. 2. Prompt structure of daily questions for descriptive records
AWARE Narrator processes sensitive information collected from raw data, such as application notifications, location
data, and keyboard inputs. While this private information is preserved and integrated within the AWARE Narrator
framework, it can be selectively excluded from the narratives in specific settings to address privacy concerns. This
flexibility allows users to balance the richness of the data with the need for privacy protection.
3.2
Analysis of the sensing statements
Given a complete set of smartphone sensing data statements for a specific period, we investigate how large language
models (LLMs) could be used to summarize the data and extract meaningful insights. For this purpose, we employed
the Gemini 1.5-flash, GPT-4o, and Claude Haiku models to perform analysis tasks.
Our first task involves prompting the LLMs with the data and asking them to generate a narrative summary that
captures a set of sensing statements for a given day. This summary can serve as a daily report of the individual’s
activities, which can be valuable for assessing daily events and monitoring mood. When extended over a longer timeline,
these narratives can be collected to analyze weekly or monthly changes in behavior and well-being.
We also posed specific questions to the LLMs to extract answers from the sets of sensing statements. These questions
can be divided into two categories: factual and analytical. Factual questions focus on descriptive information that

can be validated through numeric measures or simple calculations, while analytical questions involve speculation or
rely on the LLM’s prior knowledge, such as identifying correlational or causal relationships between elements. The
questions targeted areas such as smartphone usage, physical activity, sleep, and significant events. Rather than focusing
on questions that can be answered through simple calculations, like averages or standard deviations, we emphasized
non-numerical, open-ended information that is challenging to infer solely from sensor data. An example is "Are there
any patterns in the types of messages (e.g., work-related, social, informational)?" which can vary among different
smartphone users. Each question was sent as a separate query to the LLMs. The structure of the prompts is illustrated in
Figure 2. For the reader’s benefits, we provide the following list of sample questions that could be applied to such data:
Smartphone Usage
• What are the peak usage times for the person using smartphones throughout the day?
• Did the person spend more time interacting with others (e.g. sending messages or making calls), or on their own
(e.g. watching videos, playing games, etc.) throughout the day?
• What activities does the person use the smartphone for? What kind of role did the smartphone play in the
person’s life throughout the day (e.g., working tool, communication tool, or game device; work-related, social,
informational)?
• Did the user have any representative behavior, such as frequently changing applications, unlocking/locking their
phone, checking notifications, or frequently scrolling the application menu?
• What is the time distribution of the person using different applications throughout the day?
• What actions did the person do in their social media engagement throughout the day (e.g. scrolling, posting
posts, or giving likes)?
Physical Activity
• How many and what places did the person visit, and what kind of activities did the person presumably conduct
at these locations?
• What are the frequently visited places for the person?
• Was the visited place crowded or not?
• How long did the person spend at home?
Sleep
• Provide an estimation for how long the person slept.
• What patterns emerged regarding the first and last activities before sleep?
Significant Events
• Generate a narrative of the day for the person in chronological order.
• What are the minor behaviors that you may notice as a large language model that may not be evident or obvious
when represented with numeric data?
Analysis
• What can be revealed from the provided data (e.g. the keyboard input the person typed, the content they browse
and preference of browsed topics)? For example, the personality of the person from their tone when sending

messages, or if they initiate or respond to most calls, the schedules/plans of the person, or the opinion/background
of the person?
• What would be the highlighted events for the person for the day?
• What psychological insights into the person can be provided based on their data for the day?

Case Study
In this section, we apply AWARE Narrator and LLM queries to some data that was obtained from one of the digital
phenotyping studies we have run using AWARE-Light, namely StudentSense [3]. The StudentSense study collected data
from university students for 17 weeks during an Australian summer semester at the University of X. Data was collected
for the following sensors: application usage, battery, Bluetooth, calls, keyboard usage, geolocation, SMS messages,
screen status and WiFi.
For demonstration purposes, we have selected one of the participants with particularly comprehensive smartphone
sensing data and focused on one week of the data during which they were tracked. At the end of the week, psychological
measures were administered including the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) [5] and the International
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (I-PANAS-SF) [8]. The sequence of prompts we experimented with to generate
summaries and derive insights from the data at both daily and weekly levels are presented.

Fig. 3. AWARE Narrator example
We convert the raw data into a narrative using the AWARE Narrator framework. Figure 3 presents an example
segment of the descriptive data generated by AWARE Narrator from the participant’s data, with some critical numbers
and street names altered for privacy protection. Compared to traditional tabular sensor data, the narrative provides
more straightforward context. For instance, we can observe that at around 9:30 AM, the participant made a 10-minute
call after several attempts to reach the same person on X Sydney Road. Additional context is provided by the detected
WiFi connections; since only two connections were detected, it suggests that the participant was possibly in a less
crowded place. This level of abstraction and contextual information is difficult to obtain from numeric data alone but
provides more meaningful insights to both clinicians and the users themselves.
From Figure 3, it is evident that multiple events from different sensors can occur simultaneously, and some information
may be repeated over time (e.g., the last two lines of location information). This simultaneous occurrence and repetition
highlight the richness of the narrative data, which can capture overlapping events from different sensors. The detailed
log of the person’s day includes every details of them interacting with their smartphone and the information and

environment they are exposed to. More in-depth analysis can be developed from this detailed plain descriptive text of
behaviors.
4.1
Querying the Sets of Narrative Sensing Statements
To briefly demonstrate how answers can be extracted from the narrative information, we provide a few simple examples
using GPT-4o, queried from one day’s data of the participant. The first query addresses phone usage (Figure 4), the
second query explores the behavior of the smartphone user (Figure 5), and the third query examines the psychology of
the smartphone user (Figure 6). These three examples illustrate how general questions applied to such data can yield
meaningful insights.
Example I (Figure 4) explores the relationship between the participant and the smartphone. This example can serve
as a summary for smartphone users, offering daily or periodic reports on their smartphone usage and recommendations
for healthier usage habits. Leveraging the LLMs, the smartphone usage data can reveal problematic behaviors such
as excessive use, smartphone addiction, and nomophobia (“NoMobilePhobia"). In addition, the example captures and
classifies application usage, a task that would be challenging to perform manually with traditional analysis methods.
Translating the tabular form of application usage into textual descriptions makes it clearer for LLMs to analyze, with
application names and functionalities. Such a summary of application usage provides comprehensive insights into the
user’s smartphone behaviors and how they interact with various information sources.
Example II (Figure 5) demonstrates how the collected smartphone sensor data can be used in narrative form to extract
behavioural insights. Specifically, using evidence from various perspectives such as movement patterns, application
usage, communication patterns, activity patterns, and connectivity via WiFi and networks, the large language models
speculate on the personality and behavior based on descriptive data. We confirm the validity of information including
frequent visits, used applications, and activity timelines. Although the analysis does not speculate on personality traits
like the Big Five Personality with the open-ended question asked, it can reveal how daily smartphone interactions may
reflect personality and psychological states. This understanding can help individuals comprehend how their smartphone
usage impacts their psychological well-being.
Example III (Figure 6) presents the output from LLMs analyzing psychological insights into the participant. The
summary suggests that the participant had a “highly connected, academically focused" routine and “relied heavily
on technology with a structured yet flexible routine." This conclusion is based on the participant’s academic activity
engagement, social interactions, and location data from their smartphone. The LLMs also observe minor details, such as
staying up late, time management habits, and constant app switching. These insights, which are difficult to obtain from
raw numeric data, are valuable for analyzing psychological well-being and mental health. Previous studies indicate that
psychological states can be reflected in smartphone usage patterns, such as anxiety shown by frequent app switching
or depression indicated by keystroke patterns. The AWARE Narrator framework captures and analyzes these minor
behavioral details more effectively than traditional feature generation methods.
4.2
Applying LLMs to the Narrative Data for the Prediction of Psychometric Results
Regarding the psychological insights question, whether the information provided by the LLM ultimately provides
truthful/valid responses is an open question beyond the scope of this paper and would require validation in terms
of work that establishes associations between digital footprint data and psychological states. Furthermore, how such
psychological summaries could be used by relevant practitioners remains another interesting consideration.

What activities does the person use the smartphone for? What kind of role did the smartphone play in the person’s life throughout the
day (e.g., working tool, communication tool, or game device; work-related, social, informational)?
Analysis of Smartphone Usage for the University Student
Based on the provided data, we can infer several activities and roles that the smartphone played in the university student’s life throughout the day. Here
is a detailed analysis:
Activities the Person Uses the Smartphone For:
(1) Charging and Battery Monitoring:
• The phone was frequently charged, and the battery status was monitored multiple times throughout the day.
(2) Screen Usage:
• The phone screen was turned on and off multiple times, indicating active usage.
(3) Wi-Fi Connectivity:
• The phone connected to various Wi-Fi networks throughout the day, suggesting internet usage.
(4) Location Tracking:
• The phone’s location was tracked continuously, showing the student’s movements from home to various locations such as the university
campus, shops, and other places in Melbourne.
(5) Application Usage:
• The student opened the “Assistive Ball" app at 03:46:20.
(6) Communication:
• There was a missed call from “person 2" at 16:40:46.
Roles the Smartphone Played in the Person’s Life:
(1) Communication Tool:
• The missed call indicates that the phone was used for communication purposes.
(2) Informational Tool:
• The frequent Wi-Fi connections suggest that the phone was used to access information online, possibly for academic purposes or general
browsing.
(3) Navigation and Location Tracking:
• The continuous location updates indicate that the phone was used for navigation or location tracking, helping the student move between
different places.
(4) Utility Tool:
• The use of the “Assistive Ball" app suggests that the phone was used for utility purposes, possibly to assist with accessibility or ease of use.
(5) Entertainment or Social Tool:
• Although not explicitly mentioned, the frequent screen usage and Wi-Fi connections could imply that the phone was also used for social
media, entertainment, or other leisure activities.
Summary of the Smartphone’s Role Throughout the Day:
• Morning to Early Afternoon (00:00 - 12:00):
– The student was mostly at home, with the phone being charged and used intermittently. The phone connected to Wi-Fi and tracked the
student’s location at home.
• Midday to Early Evening (12:00 - 18:00):
– The student moved from home to various locations, including the university campus and nearby shops. The phone continued to track
locations and connect to different Wi-Fi networks.
• Evening to Night (18:00 - 22:00):
– The student returned home and continued to use the phone, with frequent Wi-Fi connections and location updates. The phone was charged
multiple times, and there was a missed call.
Conclusion:
The smartphone played a multifaceted role in the student’s life, serving as a communication tool, informational resource, navigation aid, utility device,
and possibly an entertainment or social tool. The data indicates that the student relied on the smartphone for various activities throughout the day, both
at home and while moving around the city.

role the smartphone play?
Beyond applying a general query to a phone sensing dataset, our dataset was collected during a study in which
psychometric assessments were also collected, including the DASS-21 and I-PANAS-SF as specified earlier. The combi-
nation of this weekly sensing data and accompanying psychometric results provides an opportunity to experiment with
asking LLMs to predict what questionnaire responses the smartphone user participant provided.
To test this idea, we started by taking the original narrative lists for each of the seven days in the given week and
asked the LLM to generate a narrative summary of the day in chronological order. We then combined these seven daily

What user behaviors can be revealed from the provided data (e.g., the keyboard input the person typed, the content they browse, and
preference of browsed topics)? For example, the personality of the person from their tone when sending messages or if they initiate or
respond to most calls, the schedules/plans of the person, or the opinion/background of the person?)
User Behaviors and Patterns
Based on the provided data, several user behaviors and patterns can be inferred about the university student:
Home and Movement Patterns
• Home Location: The student spends a significant amount of time at home, as indicated by frequent "home, stopping" entries.
• Frequent Short Movements: The student often moves short distances from home, typically around 11.0m to 58.0m, suggesting frequent visits
to nearby locations or neighbors.
• Longer Movements: Occasionally, the student travels further distances, such as to the main campus (995.0m to 1544.6m from home) and other
locations up to 3300.7m from home.
Daily Schedule
• Late Night Activity: The student is active late into the night, with movements and phone usage recorded past midnight until early morning
(e.g., 00:01:27 to 05:10:55).
• Morning Activity: The student starts moving around 07:01:43 and continues to be active throughout the day.

What psychological insights into the person can be provided based on their data for the day?
Psychological Insights from Smartphone Data
Based on the provided data, several psychological insights can be inferred about the university student’s behavior and lifestyle:
(1) Nocturnal Activity:
• The student was active late into the night and early morning hours, as indicated by phone usage and location changes between 00:14 and
04:03. This suggests a possible nocturnal lifestyle or irregular sleep patterns, which could be due to studying, social activities, or other
personal habits.
(2) Frequent Movement:
• The student moved around various locations in Melbourne throughout the day, including multiple stops at different street numbers and
establishments. This indicates a high level of mobility and possibly a busy schedule involving various activities or social engagements.
(3) Battery Management:
• The phone’s battery level was critically low at 0% around 13:21, leading to a shutdown. The student then charged the phone intermittently
throughout the evening, with frequent disconnections and reconnections to the charger. This behavior might indicate a lack of planning or
awareness regarding battery management, or it could be due to the student being in different locations without consistent access to charging
facilities.
(4) Social and Public Spaces:
• The student spent significant time in public and social spaces such as Riverfront Plaza, Unity Plaza, and various streets in Melbourne. This
suggests a preference for being in social environments or public areas, which could indicate extroverted tendencies or a need for social
interaction.
(5) Frequent Phone Screen Activity:
• The phone screen was turned on and off frequently, especially in the evening. This could indicate a high level of phone usage, possibly for
communication, social media, or other applications. The frequent screen activity might also suggest a habit of regularly checking the phone,
which could be linked to anxiety or a need for constant connectivity.
(6) Irregular Charging Patterns:
• The phone was charged in short bursts, often disconnecting and reconnecting within minutes. This irregular charging pattern might indicate
a lack of stable access to power sources or a habit of charging the phone only when necessary.
(7) Use of Assistive Apps:
• The student opened the app “Assistive Ball" at 02:47, which is often used for accessibility purposes or to enhance phone navigation. This
could suggest that the student has specific needs or preferences for phone usage that require assistive technology.
(8) Connectivity to Unknown Wi-Fi Networks:
• The phone connected to various unknown Wi-Fi networks throughout the day. This could indicate that the student frequently moves between
different locations with available Wi-Fi, possibly indicating a need for internet access for academic or personal purposes.
(9) Physical Activity:
• The data shows instances of walking, running, and riding a vehicle. This variety in movement types suggests that the student engages in
different forms of physical activity, which could be part of their daily routine or related to their transportation methods.
(10) Potential Stress or Anxiety:
• The frequent phone screen activity, irregular sleep patterns, and constant movement might indicate underlying stress or anxiety. The student’s
behavior could be a response to academic pressures, social obligations, or personal issues.
Overall Conclusion
The data suggests that the student leads a dynamic and possibly hectic lifestyle characterized by irregular sleep patterns, frequent movement, and high
phone usage. These behaviors could be influenced by academic responsibilities, social activities, or personal habits. Understanding these patterns can
help in providing better support and resources for managing their time, stress, and overall well-being.

narrative summaries together in order and queried this weekly summary information in terms of questions related to
the I-PANAS-SF and DASS-21. The prompt for DASS-21 and I-PANAS-SF are shown in Figure 7 and 8 respectively:
We experimented with three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude-Haiku) to summarize the descriptions
generated by the AWARE Narrator for a weekly psychological report. These LLMs were also tasked with predicting
scores for the DASS-21 and I-PANAS-SF based on the daily narratives produced by the AWARE Narrator. The results,
presented in Table 1, and Table 2 demonstrate the LLMs’ ability to summarize narratives and predict psychological
states. We observe that LLMs perform relatively well on I-PANAS-IF tasks and acceptably on DASS-21 tasks. However,
due to the limited data and the fact that this is just a demonstration where our focus is not on prediction optimization,
accuracy metric evaluations are not provided in this paper. Additionally, prompt engineering was not optimized, nor
were additional examples provided to LLMs to enhance prediction performance. This demonstration illustrates how
transforming raw tabular data into narratives using the AWARE Narrator can be beneficial in ubiquitous computing. In

Using the narrative of activities collected from smartphone sensors over the past week, estimate
the individual’s mental health based on the DASS-21 scale. This scale evaluates three subscales:
depression, anxiety, and stress, each with a maximum score of 21. For each subscale, categorize the
result into one of the following ranges:
Normal: 0 to 4
Mild: 5 to 6
Moderate: 7 to 10
Severe: 11 to 13
Extremely Severe: 14 and above
Format your output as follows:
Depression: <extent>
Anxiety: <extent>
Stress: <extent>

comparison to feeding raw numerical data into LLMs, which can exceed limits and reduce the information extracted
by the models, narratives offer a clearer and more understandable description. These narratives can be more easily
comprehended by humans, facilitating better interpretation and analysis.
Previous work has explored similar approaches to predicting psychological measures. For instance, [10] leveraged
LLMs to predict affective states by extracting daily features using RAPIDS, which calculated high-level abstracted
features such as the total duration of application usage, the total number of missed calls, and the time spent at home. In
contrast, our study directly converts each line of raw data into descriptive English narratives. This approach ensures
data completeness, preserving the information of each individual event. The comprehensive narratives produced by
the AWARE Narrator can potentially be used in conjunction with LLMs or human inspection for clinical reports,
assisting psychiatrists and psychologists in helping individuals with mental health issues. By maintaining detailed
event information, our method provides a more thorough basis for psychological assessment and intervention.

Future Work and Conclusion
Our exploratory demonstrations with the LLMs were confined to zero-shot prompts. Future work on this idea should
explore multi-shot prompting. One approach would be to include some psychological measures of interest as output
for each shot input (i.e., set of sensor descriptions). For example, the set of sensor descriptions for each of several

consecutive days could be provided as example inputs, accompanied by psychological assessments taken at the end
of those days as example outputs to improve the accuracy of the predictions. Additionally, employing a Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) could enhance how contextual information is integrated into the model.
The tasks for the LLM could then include predicting psychological assessment values for subsequent inputs without
known outputs. This paradigm may assist in the early detection of mental health issues and mood monitoring. Fine-
tuning models can also be developed for personalization or for specific cohorts (e.g., individuals with depressive
symptoms) to infer physical and mental health and well-being for self-regulation.
Another line of future work concerns extending the AWARE Narrator tool in terms of the range of descriptions it can
generate. This could be done by incorporating other sensors or sources. For example, AWARE-Light includes a novel
sensor called the screen reader, which collects text displayed on the screen [7]. This sensor can extract core information
and keywords, which can be added to the AWARE Narrator for enhanced narrative content. It could also be done by
generating descriptions that combine two or more sensors. For example, “the user was using the Spotify app whilst
travelling on a train", which involves both the application sensor and the movement sensors.
Given the highly sensitive nature of the data collected from smartphone sensors, privacy concerns can be mitigated
by running the AWARE Narrator and LLM analysis system directly on-device, thus transforming fine-grained sensor
data into an abstract summary of activities without leaving the phone.
Our investigation has demonstrated the feasibility and usability of the AWARE Narrator framework. Assisted by
large language models (LLMs), the generated narrative descriptions can be analyzed to infer behaviours, contexts,
psychological characteristics and mental health. This makes the AWARE Narrator a practical and useful tool not only
for visualizing and representing one’s engagement and behaviors with smartphones but also for understanding the

tabular data in digital phenotyping, offering insights into human behaviors and psychological states.
