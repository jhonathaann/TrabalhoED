Abstract. Close-binary central stars of planetary nebulae offer a unique tool
with which to study the critical and yet poorly understood common-envelope
phase of binary stellar evolution. Furthermore, as the nebula itself is thought to
comprise the ionised remnant of the ejected common envelope, such planetary
nebulae can be used to directly probe the mass, morphology and dynamics
of the ejecta. In this review, I summarise our current understanding of the
importance of binarity in the formation of planetary nebulae as well as what
they may be able to tell us about the common-envelope phase – including the
possible relationships with other post-common-envelope phenomena like stellar
mergers, novae and type Ia supernovae.
Key words: binaries: close – planetary nebulae: general – stars: jets
1. Introduction
It is now almost half a century since Paczynski (1976) first proposed the common-
envelope (CE) scenario as the most viable pathway towards the formation of
close binaries with an evolved component. Since then, the evidence for the im-
portance of the CE has only grown, however key aspects of the processes at work
remain enigmatic (Ivanova et al., 2013). At the time, Paczynski (1976) already
recognised the importance of planetary nebulae (PNe) in understanding the CE
phase, stating “Observational discovery of a short period binary being a nucleus
of a planetary nebula would provide very important support for the evolutionary
scenario”, and the first example was discovered that same year by Bond (1976).
Subsequent studies of post-CE planetary nebulae (PNe) have already taught us
much about the CE and they continue to represent a key tool with which to
shed light on this critical phase of binary evolution (Jones, 2020).
From the perspective of the PN community, the principal interest in CE
evolution is the ease with which it can explain the wide range of aspherical
morphologies observed in PNe (Balick & Frank, 2002; Garc´ıa-Segura et al., 2018;

De Marco et al., 2022). However, until recently, there was a reluctance to accept
that binarity was the primary shaping mechanism in PNe due to the lack of
known binary central stars. In the early 2000s, only 16 post-CE PNe were known
(a couple of which have since been shown to be wide binaries, false associations
or non-PNe) leading to the estimate that roughly 10% of PNe hosted close binary
stars (Bond, 2000). Exploitation of wide-field surveys, like OGLE, Kepler and
TESS, has since led to an explosion of new discoveries (Miszalski et al., 2009;
Jacoby et al., 2021; Aller et al., 2024), taking the total now to over 100 known
post-CE central stars1. These studies have placed a hard lower limit on the
binary fraction of 20%, while other probes (such as radial velocities, composite
spectra and infrared excesses) have provided much higher estimates (perhaps as
high as 80%; De Marco et al., 2004; Douchin et al., 2015).
The minimum 20% post-CE fraction already has one critical implication for
our understanding of PNe – it is likely that some stars which our textbooks
would say should produce an observable PN, in fact, do not. Simply put, based
on the main sequence binary fraction and period distribution, one would not
expect as many as 20% of all low- and intermediate-mass stars to experience
a CE phase, let alone survive one without merging. Clearly, with such a large
uncertainty on the true post-CE binary fraction in PNe (20–80%), it is similarly
uncertain just how large the discrepancy between the main sequence and PN
phase really is. However, there are indications that it may indeed be significant.
Population synthesis studies have found that perhaps around one fifth of ex-
pected PN progenitors due not lead to observable PNe (potentially consistent
with only binaries leading to PNe; Moe & De Marco, 2006), while as many
as 50% of central stars exhibit properties that are inconsistent with single-star
evolutionary tracks (Weidmann et al., 2020).
As a result of conservation of angular momentum during the ejection, the
CE is always expected to be preferentially deposited in the orbital plane of the
binary thus leading to nebular symmetry axes which lay perpendicular to this
plane. While only nine PNe have been the subject of sufficiently detailed study to
constrain both their nebular inclinations and central binary orbital inclinations,
the correlation is striking and entirely consistent with the CE shaping each and
every one. Indeed, the probability of finding such an alignment in these PNe
by chance has been shown to be less than one in a million (Munday et al.,
2020). Nonetheless, there is significant morphological diversity, even among this
sample, meaning that, while the CE has clearly played a role in their shaping,
the exact processes at work may vary appreciably between (Hillwig et al., 2016).
Thus, it now seems beyond doubt that CE evolution is a critical aspect of
PN formation and evolution, even though the precise details of this are still the
subject of active research (Jones & Boffin, 2017; Boffin & Jones, 2019). But,
perhaps of greater interest for the wider astronomical community, we are now
in a position to use post-CE PNe to try and understand the CE phase itself. The

nebular material in these PNe is thought to comprise the ejected CE, offering a
unique opportunity to study the ejecta directly (CE ejecta can also be observed
in luminous red novae, but these represent “failed” CE events, where the stars
merged before fully ejecting the donor’s envelope). Furthermore, the short-lived
nature of PNe (τ ∼30 kyr) means that post-CE central stars of PNe have not
yet had time to adjust following the CE ejection. As such, post-CE PNe are
an invaluable tool with which to study the CE phase leading to potentially
interesting conclusions for a wide-range of other post-CE phenomena.
2. Pre-CE mass transfer
The first step towards using the population of post-CE central stars of PNe to
try and understand the CE phase is to constrain the properties of individual
post-CE central stars. Most have been discovered through their photometric
variability meaning that only their orbital periods are known. In order to de-
termine the properties of the stars themselves (masses, temperature, radii), one
must obtain follow-up observations that allow for simultaneous modelling of
light and radial velocity curves (e.g., Jones et al., 2022), and/or spectral analy-
sis using model atmospheres (Hillwig et al., 2017).
While the number of central stars with well-constrained properties remains
relatively small, principally due to the painstaking nature of the required follow-
up observations and the complications of the modelling, one can already draw
remarkable conclusions. Where the companion to the nebula progenitor is a
main-sequence (MS) star, they are always2 found to be inflated (often by a
factor of ×2–3) with respect to isolated MS stars of the same mass (Jones
et al., 2015). This inflation is almost certainly due to accretion, with further
signposts of this accretion coming from the chemical contamination observed
in the companion of the central star of The Necklace nebula (Miszalski et al.,
2013).
Accretion during the CE phase is expected to be minimal (Sandquist et al.,
1998), so it is probable that the accretion onto the companion happens before
CE. Further evidence for accretion prior to the CE comes from the kinematical
ages of the polar outflows observed in some post-CE PNe. These polar outflows,
thought to be tracers of the mass transfer/accretion, are generally found to
predate the ejection of the central nebula (and thus the ejection of the CE) by
a few hundred to a few thousand years (Corradi et al., 2011; Miszalski et al.,
2011). It seems likely that this pre-CE mass transfer might be associated with
a period of wind Roche-lobe overflow which could last for several thousands of
years as indicated by the jets observed in Fleming 1 (Boffin et al., 2012).
2Except the companion to the central star of PN M 3-1, which was found by Jones et al.
(2019) to be of a normal size but extremely close to filling its Roche lobe (this system will be
discussed more in section 5).

It is important to note that no inflation is observed in the MS companions of
more evolved post-CE binaries (indeed these systems are excellent probes of the
mass-radius relationship of late-type MS stars; Parsons et al., 2018). This might,
at first, appear puzzling when one takes into account that the thermal timescales
for these stars are too long for them to have relaxed back to a normal state.
However, models predict that for intermediate values of accretion efficiency and
rate, the response of fully convective stars is to become partially convective
(Prialnik & Livio, 1985), and it is thus the convective layer formed in the outer
envelope which expands rather than the star as a whole. The relaxation of this
convective layer can then occur on a much shorter timescale (Jones et al., 2022).
3. Conditions to experience (and survive) a CE
The characterization of post-CE central stars has revealed a dearth of early
type-companions (Brown et al., 2019). This is consistent with the idea that
large mass ratios are required to initiate unstable Roche lobe overflow and thus
a CE event (Pavlovskii & Ivanova, 2015). The same characterization efforts
have also revealed a number of candidates to have experienced the CE while on
the red giant branch (RGB). These stars are analogous to subdwarf B binaries
(e.g., Schaffenroth et al., 2015) and serve as a clear demonstration that RGB
CE events can both be survived (without merging) and produce an observable
PN (Jones et al., 2022).
A handful of central stars have been shown to have white dwarf companions,
being detected either by radial velocity variability (Boffin et al., 2012) or pho-
tometric variability due to tidal deformations (Santander-Garc´ıa et al., 2015) –
as opposed to the sinusoidal photometric variability due to irradiation which
is typical for MS companions. If one extrapolates from this to assume that all
central stars showing photometric variability due to tidal deformations are dou-
ble degenerates (DD; Hillwig et al., 2010), then a very significant fraction of all
post-CE central stars are DD (particularly when one takes into account that
these systems should be harder to detect due to the low amplitudes of variabil-
ity for most configurations). These DD post-CE central stars may have formed
through two consecutive CE phases (Nelemans & Tout, 2005), but their prop-
erties are more consistent with having avoided a CE when the first component
evolved off the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), with the mass transfer at this
stage being stable due to the initial mass ratio being close to unity (Woods et al.,
2012). Understanding the frequency and properties (namely masses and orbital
periods) of DD central stars of PNe will likely have important implications for
the constraining the pathways towards type ia supernovae (Santander-Garc´ıa
et al., 2015).

4. The missing mass problem
In the single-star scenario, the bright central shells of PNe contain only a small
fraction of the mass that originally comprised the progenitor’s envelope, with
the vast majority residing in a very low surface brightness halo (Villaver et al.,
2002). In the case of a CE event, the entirety of the donor’s envelope is expected
to be ejected on a very short timescale, subsequently forming the PN. Thus one
would expect post-CE PNe to be significantly more massive than their single star
counterparts, however Santander-Garc´ıa et al. (2022) showed that, in fact, there
is very little difference between the masses of the two populations. Furthermore,
studying the observed masses of four PNe for which data of the central stars
permits the reconstruction of the CE phase and an estimation of the envelope
mass, they found that the masses of the PNe represent only a fraction of the
envelope masses of the donors (roughly 60% for the two DD systems analysed,
but as low as 1% for Abell 63 which has a MS companion). This brings into
question whether the nebulae surrounding post-CE central stars are indeed the
ejected CE or rather the product of some much later phase of mass-loss when
the CE has already dissipated (Corradi et al., 2015).
5. Nebular abundances and the link to novae
There are obvious links between post-CE PNe and novae, in particular the dis-
covery of an ancient PN surrounding nova V458 Vul (Wesson et al., 2008a). How-
ever, there are also other less obvious connections. The central star of PN M 3-1
was found by Jones et al. (2019) to have a MS companion which is very close to
Roche-lobe filling. This means that as the system evolves there is potential for
mass transfer from the companion onto the central star in the relatively near
future, possibly leading to a nova eruption inside the expanding PN similar to
that of Nova V458 Vul.
Further connections between post-CE PNe and novae are found in their
abundance patterns, with some of the shortest period central stars being as-
sociated with extreme abundance discrepancy PNe (Wesson et al., 2018). The
abundances in these PNe are discrepant by a factor of five or more depending
on whether they are derived using recombination lines or collisionally-excited
emission lines. These discrepancies indicate the presence of a second (often
centrally-concentrated) high-metallicty gas phase in these PNe (Garc´ıa-Rojas
et al., 2016), where the abundances of this second gas phase are similar to those
observed in neon novae (Wesson et al., 2008b).
6. Pre-PNe and the link to luminous red novae
Pre-PNe are thought to represent the intermediate phase between the central
star having left the AGB but not yet being hot enough to fully ionise the sur-

rounding nebula. As such, one might expect to find a similar post-CE fraction
inside pre-PNe to that found in PNe. However, despite years of dedicated study,
no post-CE central star has been found inside a pre-PN (see Hrivnak et al., 2011,
2017, 2022, 2024, and many, many more). This is perhaps indicative that the
CE leads to a shortened pre-PN phase (reducing the likelihood of discovery) or
even that pre-PNe and post-CE PNe represent distinct evolutionary pathways.
Intriguingly, the ejecta properties of luminous red novae – a class of tran-
sients associated with CE mergers – are strikingly similar to those of pre-PNe
(Kami´nski et al., 2018), offering a potential explanation for the dearth of sur-
viving post-CE binaries in pre-PNe. Although, it must be highlighted that much
progress has been made linking the morphologies of pre-PNe with wide stellar
companions (Decin et al., 2020), several of which are known in both pre-PNe
(e.g., S´anchez Contreras et al., 2004) and PNe (e.g., Jones et al., 2017).
7. Conclusions
Binary evolution (both CE and wider) plays a key role in the formation of a sig-
nificant fraction, perhaps the majority, of PNe (some might even argue all!). This
makes PNe an important test bed with which to study binary stellar evolution
– in particular the poorly understood CE phase, which has been demonstrated
to be responsible for at least one fifth of all PNe. The fact that post-CE PNe
should be among the youngest observable post-CE systems, potentially allowing
for direct observations of both the ejected envelope and the surviving post-CE
binary, furthermore makes them a unique probe of the CE.
The observed population of post-CE PNe confirms the theoretical expecta-
tions that the CE is preferentially ejected in the orbital plane of the binary and
that a relatively large initial mass ratio is required in order for unstable mass
transfer to occurr. There are also strong indications of pre-CE mass transfer
which can chemically contaminate the companion (now the favoured hypothesis
for the formation of carbon dwarfs; Whitehouse et al., 2021) as well as (tem-
porarily) causing their radii to grow. However, not all properties of post-CE PNe
are so easily understood – the so-called missing mass problem, and the origins
of a second chemically-enriched gas phase in high abundance discrepancy neb-
ulae are particularly puzzling. The resolution of these puzzles will undoubtedly
further our understanding of the CE phase as well as of other CE progeny.
