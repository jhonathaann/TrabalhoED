We explore the influence of interactions between dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) on the
cosmic evolution of the Universe within a viscous dark energy (VDE) framework. Moving beyond
traditional interacting dark energy (IDE) models, we propose a generalized IDE model adaptable to
diverse IDE scenarios via IDE coupling parameters. In order to investigate deviations from ΛCDM
across cosmic epochs by highlighting how viscous and the interactions between DM and DE impact
cosmic density and expansion rates, we consider a model agnostic form of VDE. Eventually we
perform a Bayesian analysis using the Union 2.1 Supernova Ia dataset and Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling to obtain optimal values of model parameters. This comprehensive analysis
provides insights about the interplay between viscous and IDE in shaping the Universe’s expansion
history.

INTRODUCTION
There is no denying that a new data driven age in modern cosmology has begun. In 1998, Supernova Type Ia (SNIa)
[1, 2] observation first discovered that the Universe is not only expanding, but also accelerating. Subsequently, the
phenomenon of the Universe’s late time acceleration have been confirmed by several studies such as the measurement
of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) [3] in the galaxy power spectrum, large scale structure observation and Cosmic
Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) [4, 5] observations. The known luminous object in the Universe accounts
for only about 4.9% of the total mass energy budget of the Universe.
The analysis of satellite borne PLANCK
experiment on the anisotropy of CMBR suggests that the Universe overwhelmingly contains unknown dark matter
(DM) and dark energy (DE). The former one is an unseen unknown matter, whose only definite evidence so far is
due to their gravitational effects, makes up for around 26.8% of the Universe’s contents. The rest around 69.3% is
yet another unknown energy known as DE thought to invoke a negative pressure opposite to gravity and cause the
recent accelerated expansion of the Universe.
As previously mentioned, the pressure acts in opposition to gravity to accelerate the Universe against the propensity
of an eventual gravitational collapse caused by the mass contained within the Universe. Since then, a number of
theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain the nature and origin of the mysterious DE and the ensuing late
temporal acceleration. The cosmological constant scenario, which is popularly known as ΛCDM model, is considered to
be a DE candidate. Recent PLANCK CMB measurements have validated the ΛCDM model as a phenomenologically
feasible cosmological model [6].
However, this well known model (ΛCDM model) is insufficient to fully describe
our Universe [7]. The physical properties of DE and DM are still an enigma from a theoretical perspective. The
cosmological constant has long standing coincidence and fine tuning issues [7, 8] . According to observations, the

ΛCDM model can satisfactorily explain cosmic large - scale structures, but it encounters several challenges at the
dwarf - galaxy scale, including the well known issues with missing satellites, core - cusp and too - big - to - fail
problems [9]. A few disparities between various observations under ΛCDM have appeared and become increasingly
significant in the last few years. The most prominent one is the H0 tension, obtained from Planck CMB data, which
is around 5σ apart from the values acquired from standard candles and lensing time - delay observations [10–12]. The
other less important one is the S8 tension having a 1 - 2σ differ between the value of S8 = σ8(Ωm)0.5 bounded by
Planck CMB and that from weak lensing measurements [13–16].
Since, we still don’t completely understood how realistic the DE is, cosmologists have put out a plethora of options
to address these mysteries. In general, we can classify them into two major categories, i.e., the DE models [17, 18] and
modified theory of gravity. Within the context of general relativity (GR) [19, 20], the former one seeks to introduce
a new cosmic fluid or matter field. However, in the latter scenario, the standard GR lagrangian is modified by a
physical mechanism that is specific to the breakdown of Einstein’s gravity.
From thermodynamics it can be stated that, a Universal feature of any realistic fluid dynamics is dissipative process.
This dissipative process has been taken into account to conduct several cosmological analyses. Both bulk and shear
viscosity in the stress energy tensor of the cosmic fluid [21, 22] are furnished by such dissipative process. Although
the shear viscosity can be disregarded at large scales in the case of isotropic and homogeneous Universe, but the
impact of bulk viscosity has been widely studied in the context of viscous dark matter (VDM) [23, 24], viscous
dark energy (VDE) [25–28] and cosmic inflation. Additionally, in various models, viscosity has been suggested as
a possible explanation for the current acceleration. Viscosity not only modifies the Hubble evolution, but it also
produces additional entropy that warms the baryon and dark matter fluids that may affect the thermal evolution of
the Universe.
In the present work, the possible impact of the DM and DE interaction in VDE framework on the dynamics of
the Universe has been addressed. In lieu of considering different interacting dark energy (IDE) models [29–31], we
introduce an generalized IDE model in our calculation. Different IDE models can be obtained from this generalized
model by tuning its parameters. The evolution equation of Hubble parameters due to different VDE models can also
be acquired from a generalized expression as introduced in [32]. In our analysis, we investigate the dynamics of the
Universe is studied by studying evolution of cosmological density parameters and higher order evolution parameters
namely, deceleration parameter (q), jerk parameter (j) and snap parameter (s). In order to understand the variation
of the Universe’s mass fraction over time, an extensive study has been done on Om parameter in the present work.
We further extend our analysis using three point diagnostic Om3 parameter as described in [33].
The paper is organized as follows.
In section II we discussed about interplay between DM and DE. Different
VDE models and their effect on the evolution of Hubble parameter have been discussed extensively in section III.
Calculations and results are shown in section IV. Eventually, in section V some concluding remarks are given.

INTERPLAY BETWEEN DARK MATTER AND DARK ENERGY
The interaction between DM and DE could significantly influence universal dynamics, including the optical depth
and spin temperature of the 21-cm transition. In the standard cosmological model, the density parameters of DM
(Ωχ) and DE (Ωde) evolve as Ωχ,0(1+z)3 and Ωde,0(1+z)3(1+ωde) respectively, where Ωχ,0 and Ωde,0 are the respective
density parameters at the redshift z = 0, and ωde is the equation of state (EOS) parameter of DE. However, the DM
and DE densities, in the presence of their in between interactions, have been evolved in the following manner [34]:
(1 + z)H(z)dρχ
dz −3H(z)ρχ = −Q
(1)
(1 + z)H(z)dρde

−3H(z)(1 + ωde)ρde = Q
(2)
Here, Q denotes the energy transfer between DM and DE due to DM-DE interaction. In this work, we consider three
benchmark models to investigate the effect of DM-DE interaction on brightness temperature. The energy transfer
expressions for those benchmark models are described below [35–38]:
Model-I
Q = 3λH(z)ρde
Model-II
Q = 3λH(z)ρχ
Model-III
Q = 3λH(z)(ρde + ρχ)

Here, λ is the coupling parameter, determining the strength of the DM - DE interaction and ρde, ρχ are the

phenomenological studies have constrained these models using observational data from PLANCK, SNIa, and BAO
[37–44].
All these three models can be expressed using a general expression given by,
Q = 3H(z)(λdeρde + λχρχ).

In the above equation, λde(λχ) indicated the coupling parameter for DE (DM). In the present analysis we parame-
terize the coupling parameters λχ and λde in terms of λr and λθ, as
λχ = λr sin(λθ)

λde = λr cos(λθ)

VISCOUS DARK ENERGY (VDE) MODELS
The dynamics of the Universe may be significantly impacted by the presence of viscosity in the dark energy fluid.
The two Freidmann equations that govern the dynamics of Friedmann - Robertson - Walker (FRW) Universe are as
follows

(7)
In the above equations, the dot represents the derivative with respect to the cosmic time t, whereas the parameters
a, ρ and p stand for the scale factor, energy densities and pressure of the cosmic fluids, which include relativistic
radiation, baryon matter, DM and DE, respectively. Throughout this work, we consider 8πG = c = ℏ= 1. The stress
- energy tensor of a cosmic DE fluid with the bulk viscosity ζ is expressed as
T de
µν = ρdeUµUν + pdehµν,
(8)
where pde and ρde indicate the effective pressure and the energy density of the VDE fluid respectively. Uµ is the four
- velocity of the VDE fluid in comoving coordinates, where Uµ = (1, 0, 0, 0) and the projection tensor is denoted by
hµν = gµν + UµUν. According to Eckart’s theory as a first order limit of the Israel - Stewart scenario having zero
relation time, the effective pressure pde at thermodynamical equilibrium for a typical VDE fluid can be restated as
[21]
pde = ωdeρde = ζθ.
(9)
In the above equation, ωde, ζ and θ denote the equation of state (EoS) of DE fluid, bulk viscosity and expansion
scalar respectively. Moreover, the energy conservation equation associated with the VDE fluid can be expressed as
˙
ρde + θ(pde + ρde) = 0,
(10)
where θ = 3H = ˙a
a and H defines the Hubble parameter, which governs the background evolution of the Universe.
In our analysis, we assume that the bulk viscosity of DE is proportional to the Hubble parameter as ζ = ηH, where
η is a dimensionless free parameter. Therefore, the effective pressure pde in Equation 9 turns out as
pde = ωdeρde −3ηH2.

The effects of three VDE models have been investigated in our analysis.
• Model I (VΛDE): A one parameter extension of the conventional six parameter ΛCDM model has been taken
into account in this first model. Here ωde is fixed at -1. Therefore, we refer this model as the VΛDE model and its
effective pressure takes the form pde = −ρde −3ηH2. The dimensionless Hubble parameter H(z) of the VΛDE model
is given by

where the present value of the Hubble parameter is denoted as H0. In the above equation (Equation 12), z and Ωm,0
represent the redshift and current density parameter of matter including both baryonic matter and DM. It is to be
noted that, the contribution from the radiation and spatial curvature components have been ignored in this model.
If we put η = 0 in Equation 12, then VΛDE model will be reduced to the standard ΛCDM model.
• Model II (VωDE): In this model, an additional free parameter ωde is introduced along with the viscosity
parameter η. Therefore, this model has been mentioned as VωDE model. Furthermore, the Hubble parameter H(z)
in VωDE model can be expressed as

• Model III (VKDE): In order to account for the impact of bulk viscosity on the spatial curvature, we incorporate
the curvature contribution into the cosmic pie. The present vakue of the curvature density parameter Ωk is considered
as another model parameter. We can exhibit the corresponding Hubble parameter of the VKDE model as
H(z) = H0

(14)
where Ωk,0 is the current curvature density parameter. In Table II, we tabulate the constraints and parameters of the
three individual models. Since bulk viscosity has minimal effect at low redshifted epochs, the evolution of Universe
closely resembles the standard ΛCDM cosmology for lower redshifts. The bulk viscosity of DE is addressed by th
three previously mentioned VDE models. At lower redshift, the second model offers a relatively faster expansion of
the Universe for ωde ≤−1, as an extra effect of ωde (EoS of DE) is considered. The expansion rate, however, sharply
declines for ωde ⪆−0.7. In contrast the third VDE model investigates the impact of the Universe’s spatial curvature
in the presence of viscous flow of DE. It can be observed that the evolution of the Universe is minimally modified. at
late times according to the recent bounds of curvature.
The generalized expression of the Hubble parameter for all three models (Equation 12, Equation 13, Equation 14)
can be written as

CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS
How the interactions between DM and DE impact the evolution of the Universe within a VDE framework has
been explored in this work. Rather than relying on conventional IDE models, we introduce a generalized IDE model
that can represent a wide array of IDE scenarios by tuning its parameters, λr and λθ. By adopting a generalized
form of the Hubble parameter in VDE framework, we establish a basis for our calculations. This form enables us to
systematically analyze the dynamic effects of viscosity and dark sector interactions on cosmic evolution, facilitating a
versatile approach to studying different IDE conditions within a unified framework.
In Figure 1, the Hubble evolutions with redshift z are shown for different chosen parameter values. In this regard, we
consider a set of benchmark values of the model parameters as shown in Table III. The Hubble evolution corresponding
to these benchmark values (blue dashed line) exhibits slightly lower values of H(z)/H0 for different redshifts z
compared to that of the ΛCDM model (black dashed line). It is to be noted that for the ΛCDM model, we choose
h0 = 0.674. The green solid line represents the same for λr = 0.05, while keeping the values of the other parameters
the same as in Table III. Similarly, the blue solid line, red solid line, cyan solid line, and magenta solid line describe
the Hubble evolution with redshift z for λθ = π/3, ωde = −0.95, Ωk,0 = 0.05, and η = 0.1, respectively, while keeping
the other parameters fixed at benchmark values for individual cases. From this figure, it can be seen that the effect
of Ωk,0 is minimal on the evolution of the Hubble parameter.
In presence of VDE and interaction between DM and DE, the evolution history of the density parameters are
remarkably different from the ΛCDM model (see Figure 2(a)). In Figure 2(a), the black and green solid lines represent
the evolution of dark matter density parameter Ωde for the case of ΛCDM model and the present model with the
benchmark values of model parameters (see Table III).
The red and blue solid lines represent the same for the
benchmark values with additional modifications h0 = 0.7 and η = 0.1 respectively. The dashed, dash-dotted and
dotted lines of corresponding colour exhibits the evolution of dark matter density parameter (Ωχ), baryon density
parameter (Ωb) and radiation density parameter (Ωrad) respectively for individual cases. From this figure one can see
that, at the present epoch the values of density parameters are independent to model and model parameters, however
the dependence on model and model parameters become prominent as we approach toward higher values of z. Here,
the effect of h0 is prominent in the case of Ωrad only, while it is negligible in the cases of dark matter,dark energy and
baryons. On the other hand, the density parameters for all constituents of the Universe show notable variation for
η = 0.1.
We also show a parametric representation of dark energy density parameter Ωde and matter density parameter Ωm,
i.e. Ωχ + Ωb in Figure 2(b). Here the ΛCDM model demonstrate a straight line (black dashed line), while in presence

of the interactions in dark sector components, the representative lines become curved. From the magenta line of this
figure (Figure 2(b)) one can conclude that the bulk viscosity parameter η plays a crucial role in the estimation of the
curvature of that line.

In the above expressions, q denotes the deceleration parameter of the Universe. It can alternatively be expressed as
q = −¨aa
˙a2 , where a denotes the scale factor, and the over-dot signifies the time derivative. Additionally, the parameter
j represents the jerk parameter, which characterizes the rate of change of the deceleration parameter with time. The
snap parameter s represents the rate of change of the jerk parameter with time and the Om parameter provides a
measure of the cosmic acceleration relative to the gravitational attraction exerted by matter.
In order to distinguish the model adopted in this work from the model inspired by ΛCDM it may be worthwhile
to express the Om3 parameter for the model. The Om parameter has been extensively studied in the earlier works
[46]. The Om parameter is generally defined in terms of hubble parameter in a way that can directly be measured in
cosmological observations. The Om parameter can be defined as a two point diagnostic given by [33, 47]
Om(z2, z1) =
h2(z2) −h2(z1)
(1 + z2)3 −(1 + z1)3 ,
(21)
with z1 = 0, the Om parameter reduces to
Om(z, 0) = Om(z) =
h2(z) −1
(1 + z2)3 −1.
(22)
In general, when z1 < z2, Om(z1, z2) > 0

with x = z + 1 and h(x) = H(x)/H0, it can be shown that, for ΛCDM Om(x) = Ωm,0. Also Om(x) > Ωm,0 for
quintessence and Om(x) < Ωm,0 for phantom. In terms of z1 and z2 for ΛCDM, Om(z1, z2) = Ωm,0. When z1 < z2,
the value of Om(z1, z2) is greater that zero (case of quintessence), whereas Om(z1, z2) < 0 represents the case of
phantom. Thus the Om parameter can be useful in distinguishing the DE models. Now the three point diagnostic
Om3 is defined as [33]
Om3(z1, z2, z3) = Om(z2, z1)
Om(z3, z1) = h2(z2) −h2(z1)
h2(z3) −h2(z2)
(1 + z3)3 −(1 + z1)3
(1 + z2)3 −(1 + z1)3 .
(23)
For ΛCDM model Om3 = 1 for any redshift z. In Figure 3(a) we show the variation of Om(z) with redshift z. In
this case z1 = 0 has been chosen. In this plot ΛCDM is shown in black dashed line. As expected this is a straight
line parallel to z axis at Om(z) = Ωm,0 ∼0.31. The other cases represent the DE model considered here but with
different parameters. It appears that all the cases are close to each other except for the case where the viscosity
η = 0.10, which differs from the from the rest to a considerable extent. Note that, for other cases,the viscosity is fixed
at a value η = 0.30. It appears that as the fluid gets more viscous, the Om parameter tends to deviate more than the
ΛCDM case. It can also be noted from Figure 3(a) that with the increasing λr (DM - DE interaction strength) the
model deviates more from the ΛCDM model.
In Figure 3(b), we plot Om3(z1, z2, z3) with (z3 −z2) while z1, z2 are kept fixed. The value of z1, z2 are fixed at
z1 = 0.20 [48], z2 = 0.57 [49] respectively and z3 is allowed to vary. From Figure 3(b) it is seen that the all variations
pass through the point where z3 = z2 and at that point Om3 = 1. The deviation of Om from 1 to < 1 indicates
the phantom nature of dark energy. From this figure (Figure 3(b)) in can also be observed that with the progress of
Universe’s evolution, as redshift decreases, the dark energy tends to represent the quintessence case.
In the analysis depicted in Figure 4(a), the newly proposed model consistently exhibits a lower value of q(z)
compared to the ΛCDM model, as obtained from the plots. Consequently, the graphs illustrating the jerk parameter
j(z) (Figure 4(b)) and snap parameter s(z) (Figure 4(c)) depict higher values relative to the standard cosmic model
(ΛCDM). Notably, the line generated with benchmark values closely aligns with the solid blue line in the plot of
deceleration parameter (q(z)), although a small discrepancies observed in higher-order parameters (j(z) and s(z)).
From this figure (Figure 4) one can investigate the impact of λr in the dynamics of the Universe, which essentially
represents the strength of the DM - DE interaction. It is observed that adjustments in λr contribute to an increase
in q both at present and in future cosmic dynamics, while concurrently leading to lower values of j(z) and s(z)
across the redshift range. The equation of state parameter for dark energy Ωde significantly influences the behavior
of cosmological parameters. Variations in Ωde lead to discernible effects on q(z) as well as j(z) and s(z), underscoring
the pivotal role of dark energy in shaping expansion dynamics. The effect of the universal curvature is similar to the
same for ωde, but lower in magnitude. The curvature of the Universe is represented in this analysis by the present-day
curvature density parameter Ωk,0. The effect of the viscous parameter η reveals significant influence on cosmological
parameters. The magenta line denotes the case where the value of η is modified to η = 0.10 from the benchmark set
of parameters. It can be observed that the lower value of η provides higher values of deceleration and lower values of
jerk and snap parameter (j(z) and s(z) respectively).

Variation of (a) q, (b) j and (c) s parameters with redshift z for different sets of model parameters
In the subplots of Figure 5, we visually represent the present deceleration parameter q0 across the λr −λθ parameter
plane for different values of η: η = 0.0, η = 0.1, η = 0.3, and η = −0.1, corresponding to Figure 5(a), Figure 5(b),
Figure 5(c), and Figure 5(d), respectively. A noticeable trend emerges wherein, for any given η, the fluctuation of q0
with respect to λr is most within the range π/12 ≤λθ ≤π/6. This fluctuation diminishes for both lower and higher
values of λθ (λθ ≤π/12 and λθ ≥π/6), reaching a minimum at π/2.
The plots reveal that for higher values of η (e.g., η = 0.3 in Figure 5(c)), the fluctuation of q0 is more and q0
increases with increasing λr. However, the resulting range of q0 (∼−0.9) deviates significantly from the same for the
case of ΛCDM model. Conversely, as lower values of η are considered, the numerical value of q0 increases, approaching
∼−0.5 for η ∼0.0. Furthermore, our analysis extends to negative values of η, where q0 increases further for more
negative chosen values of η (⪅−0.52). An additional phenomena can also be observed that, at lower values of η, the
fluctuation of q0 diminishes significantly, completely disappears around η ≈0.006 (see Figure 6). Further reduction
in η prompts q0 to decrease with increasing θr and the rate of this inverse fluctuation amplifying as η decreases even
further.
The variation of q0 with η is illustrated in Figure 6 for different chosen sets of λr and λθ. From Figure 6 it can be
seen that, the values of q0 decreases with increasing η. Although for every set of λr and λθ, the values of q0 are almost
same, the values of q0 falls more rapidly with η at higher values of λr. This nature also can be noticed in Figure 5.
The optimum values from the posterior plots are h0 = 0.68, λr = 0.09, λθ = 0.41, ωde = −1.07, Ωk,0 = 0.10 and
η = 0.05. However it can be seen that, for the case of λr the population increases with approaching lower values of
λr. On the other hand, λθ is an angle ranges −π to π, so in this case the case of optimum point is not significant,
here the most probable value of λθ ≈7π/10.
We conduct a Bayesian analysis to compare our model with the Union 2.1 supernova Ia data. To perform this
comparison, we calculate the distance modulus using standard cosmological distance relations incorporating the
proposed cosmological model. This calculated distance modulus is then compared with the same as obtained from the

Union 2.1 supernova Ia data. In our analysis, the posterior distributions of different parameters are obtained using the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iteration method (Figure 7) via the MCMCSTAT package [50, 51]. We utilize
a total of 105 events with an adaptation interval of 500, within the parameter ranges: h0 ∈[0.6, 0.8], λr ∈[0.0, 0.2],
λθ ∈[−π, π], ωde ∈[−1.5, −0.7], Ωk,0 ∈[0.0, 0.2] and η ∈[−0.3, 0.5].
The topmost plots in the first, second, third, and fourth columns of Figure 7 represent the posterior distribution for
the parameters h0, λr, λθ, ωde, Ωk,0 and η respectively. The remaining plots in Figure 7 show contour representations
of the posterior distribution in various two-parameter spaces. In these contour plots, darker regions denote higher
posterior probabilities, and the lines indicate the boundaries of the 1σ, 2σ, and 3σ regions.
From this analysis, the obtained set of optimum points are h0 = 0.68+0.03

be seen that, the fluctuation of population with Ωk,0 is not very prominent, the pick in the histogram plot for Ωk,0 is
also small. So one can conclude that the effect of curvature term is not significant in the dynamics of the Universe
where our proposed model is considered. A similar characteristic can be observed in the 1-D histogram plot for ωde,
although the pick is prominent in this particular case. On the other hand, the mixing angle λθ can be varied within
π to π, in this case the pick is located at ≈7π/10. The histogram plot corresponds to λr clearly indicates that the

lower value of λr fits well with the observational data. The posterior distribution for h0 and η are resemble to the
Gaussian distribution. The optimum values of h0 and η are respectively h0 = 0.68 and η = 0.05.

SUMMERY AND CONCLUSION
In this work, using a viscous dark energy framework, we examine how the interaction of dark matter and dark
energy affects the evolution of the universe. We present a generalized interacting dark energy (IDE) model that
can adjust to different IDE scenarios by varying its parameters, λr and λθ, instead of depending on traditional IDE
models. Using this generalized model, we analyze the evolution of the Hubble parameter, incorporating nonzero bulk
viscosity for dark energy. We begin with discussing three established viscous dark energy scenarios. Following this,
we adopt a generalized form of the Hubble parameter for the VDE scenario, as introduced in one of our previous
works [32], and eventually modify it to account for interacting dark energy scenarios.
We show the evolution of the Hubble parameter with redshift z under different VDE and IDE scenarios and the
fluctuation from the same as calculated for ΛCDM model in Figure 1. This figure demonstrates that higher values
of viscosity slow down the expansion, suggesting that viscous effects in DE may act as resistance to acceleration.
Interaction between dark matter and dark energy further modifies the expansion rate.
A comparison of the evolution of cosmic density parameters in a VDE and interacting DM - DE model is drawn
in Figure 2(a). In Figure 2(a), the dark matter density parameter, Ωχ, the dark energy density parameter, Ωde,
the baryon density parameter, Ωb, and the radiation density parameter, Ωrad, are shown with different benchmark
parameters. The plot reveals that, while the density parameters for different cosmic components are similar across
models at the current epoch. However differences from the ΛCDM model grow at higher redshifts. It can be observed
that an increased value of viscosity parameter η helps to deviate the density parameters more from the same as
calculated for ΛCDM model.
In Figure 2(b), a parametric representation of the dark energy density parameter Ωde and total matter density
parameter, Ωm (sum of Ωχ and Ωb), shows a straight line trend for ΛCDM model. In contrast, the inclusion of dark
sector interactions results in curved lines and the curvature essentially sensitive to the bulk viscous parameter η.
Figure 3(a) shows the variation of Om(z) with redshift z. Om parameter for ΛCDM model is shown by a dashed
black line, which remains almost unchanged at Om(z) = 0.31. However, a significant deviation is observed for the
case of higher viscous dark energy. From Figure 3(a), it is also observed that, an increasing value of λr results in
more pronounced deviations from ΛCDM.
The three-point diagnostic parameter Om3(z1, z2, z3) is plotted with varying z3 in Figure 3(b), keeping z1 = 0.20
and z2 = 0.57 fixed. For the ΛCDM model, the parameter Om3 remains consistently at unity across all redshifts.
From Figure 3(b), one can see that, all curves pass through Om3 = 1 at z3 = z2, however the value of Om3 parameter
lie less than unity at z3 > z2. Here the values of Om parameter less than unity suggests a phantom-like dark energy
behavior, while decreasing redshift (progression toward the present Universe) trends toward a quintessence-like nature

Ia data. The histograms on the diagonal show the marginalized posterior densities for each parameter.
of dark energy (Om3 > 1), which can be seen at z3 < z −2.
In Figure 4(a), our proposed model demonstrates consistently lower values of the deceleration parameter q(z)
relative to the ΛCDM model, while the jerk parameter j(z) and snap parameter s(z) exhibit higher values. The
benchmark parameters (dashed blue line) align closely with the deceleration parameters calculated with a fixed value
of η, although slight deviations appear for the case of j(z) and s(z). From (Figure 4) one can analyze the impact of
the interaction strength λr on the Universe’s evolution. Increases in λr result in higher q values, both presently and in
future scenarios, while lowering j(z) and s(z) across the redshift range. In contrast, a completely opposite phenomena
is observed at z ⪆0.4. Furthermore, the dark energy equation of state parameter ωde significantly influences the
evolution of q(z), j(z), and s(z), emphasizing dark energy’s central role in cosmic expansion dynamics. The curvature
term’s influence (Ωk,0) is minimal to that of ωde but with reduced magnitude. Modifying the viscous parameter η
reveals a substantial effect on all parameters. The magenta line in Figure 4(a) shows that lowering η to 0.10 enhances
deceleration, while j(z) and s(z) are reduced for the same.
The subplots in Figure 5 graphically depicts the value of present deceleration parameter q0 in the λr −λθ parameter

12
plane for different vaues of η: η = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, and −0.1. There is a tendency that the variation of q0 with regard to
λr is most noticeable within π/12 ≤λθ ≤π/6. Both at lower and higher values of λθ, th fluctuation decreases and it
reached its minimum value at λθ ≈π/2.
Figure 5(c) shows that with higher η values, as in η = 0.3, q0 increases with increasing λr. On the other hand,
as a lower value of η is considered, the variation of q0 with λr decreases and from η ⪆0.006 (see Figure 6) it starts
showing reverse variation. It is also observed that, at lower values of η correspond to higher q0 values, approaching
−0.5 for η ≈0.0.
A Bayesian analysis is performed to compare the proposed model with Union 2.1 supernova Ia dataset. Using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with 100,000 events, the posterior distributions for parameters namely h0, λr,
λθ, ωde, Ωk,0, and η were obtained within their specified ranges. The MCMC results highlighted the optimal parameter
values: h0 = 0.68, λr = 0.09, λθ = 0.41, ωde = −1.07, Ωk,0 = 0.10, and η = 0.05. Posterior distributions in Figure 7
showed that variations in the curvature term Ωk,0 have minimal effect on cosmic dynamics, whereas parameters like
λθ and ωde show prominent peaks, indicating significant influence. Therefore, in the presence of viscosity in DE fluid,
the evolution of Universe has been significantly influenced by DM - DE interaction.
