Abstract. The Hubble tension refers to the significant discrepancy in the Hubble constant H0
obtained from two different measurement methods in cosmology. One method derives data
from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations by the Planck satellite, yielding
a value of 67.4 ± 0.5 km s−1Mpc−1, while the other method relies on direct measurements of
Type Ia supernovae, producing a value 73.04±1.04 km s−1Mpc−1. This issue has persisted for
several years. To theoretically explore potential solutions to this problem, this paper examines
a model within the framework of Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory, where torsion is introduced
with spin as the corresponding entity, allowing for the assumption H = −αϕ. By employing
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and utilizing Cosmic Chronometers (CC)
data, we impose parameter constraints on various parameters in the Friedmann equations,
particularly focusing on the curvature density parameter Ωk, to assess whether the model
remains stable under this assumption and whether the estimated parameters align more
closely with either of the observational results. In conclusion, we find that the parameter
constraints in the model incorporating torsion (H0 = 67.6+2.1
−2.7 km s−1 Mpc−1, obtained under
the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraint with Ωk = 0; H0 = 66.2+4.4
−2.9 km s−1 Mpc−1,
obtained under same constraint but set Ωk as a free variable; H0 = 68.8+2.9
−4.2 km s−1 Mpc−1,
obtained under the Planck constraint) are more consistent with the value derived from CMB
data, favoring the lower H0 value.

Introduction
Since Einstein proposed General Relativity in 1915, the theory has successfully explained
a range of astronomical phenomena, such as the precession of Mercury’s perihelion and
the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, becoming the cornerstone of modern gravitational
theory [1]. However, this framework is not complete in some aspects. One of its limitations
is the inability to account for the spacetime structure in the presence of fermions with spin
angular momentum. To address this, ´Elie Cartan introduced torsion in 1922 as the spin
counterpart in the [2], partially filling the gap in General Relativity’s description of the
impact of spinning particles on spacetime.
By the 1950s, scholars had widely integrated General Relativity with spin theory, gradu-
ally forming the Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory [3], which successfully described certain obser-
vational phenomena (albeit not uniquely). Examples include [4] using EC theory to describe
massive, dense objects and [5] interpreting dark energy as torsion to explain the dynami-
cal evolution of the universe. To this day, the theory continues to evolve and serves as the
foundation for the discussions in this paper [6].
In EC theory, the Riemann curvature tensor can be written as: Rρ
σµν = ∂µΓρ
νσ −∂νΓρ
µσ +
Γρ
µλΓλ
νσ −Γρ
νλΓλ
µσ. In the case where the Christoffel symbols is symmetric (under the torsion-
free condition), it is evident that the curvature tensor also exhibits a symmetric form, indicat-
ing that the curvature primarily reflects the symmetric and global structure of the spacetime.
However, the torsion tensor is different. It is defined as Sρ
µν = Γρ
[µν], and is an anti-symmetric
tensor. Moreover, it is not difficult to see that its definition does not specify a zero point,
which implies that torsion is always a relative value, reflecting the degree of deviation from
the symmetric structure.
However, when we contract the Riemann tensor to obtain the
– 1 –

Ricci scalar, ˜R = R + KµνρKµνρ, we find that compared to the tensor contraction result R
of torsion-free case, an additional summation term involving the contorsion tensor appears.
This term stands alongside the spatial curvature term,
k
a2 , in the original Ricci scalar. This
indicates that although curvature and torsion influence the geometry of spacetime in different
ways, their ultimate impact on the dynamical factors is similar.
There is currently no direct observational evidence for torsion, as its associated physi-
cal quantities require observations in extreme environments, such as high matter or energy
densities. Nevertheless, this does not diminish the potential of EC theory as a promising
framework for explaining the universe. Over the past decade, EC theory has achieved sig-
nificant advancements in a variety of research directions. It has been applied, for instance,
to solve the strong CP problem [7] and explain the intrinsic mechanisms behind the ac-
celerated expansion of the universe [8]. It also plays a role in large-scale structural issues,
where, combined with numerical simulation methods, it has been used to explore the impact
of torsion-induced density perturbations on the evolution of cosmic structures, including
large-scale formations [9] and cosmic strings [10] in the universe.
In other areas, EC theory has also seen progress. Efforts have been made to maintain
Weyl invariance in both global and local formulations [11], while the homogeneous spin fluid
model has been utilized to address the theoretical issue of singularity formation [12]. The
theory has also been expanded into the Einstein-Cartan-Kibble-Sciama (ECKS) theory, which
introduces torsion to generate a strong repulsive force at small scales, thus preventing the
formation of singularities [13]. This approach offers an alternative to the classical inflation
model in explaining the early universe’s expansion. Among the various research directions,
gravitational waves have become a particularly active field. In [14], the authors recalculated
the Weyssenhoff-fluid model under torsion conditions, deriving the power of gravitational
waves emitted by binary neutron stars in the post-Newtonian approximation. Similar studies
[15], [16] have further explored gravitational waves in the context of EC theory. These series
of attempts to integrate popular research topics with EC theory directly reflects the necessity
of exploring its combination with EC theory in addressing the Hubble tension problem.
The analysis in this paper employs parameter constraints to explore the dynamic evolu-
tion of torsion and curvature in the universe, representing a further study of EC theory under
the FLRW metric. The main research object, torsion tensor, is a (1,2)-type tensor field on
an n-dimensional affine connection space (M, D), while the curvature tensor is a (1,3)-type
tensor field. Both of them are important invariants that characterize the differences between
an affine connection space and an affine space. Therefore, the fundamental objective of our
research is to provide an explanation for the asymmetrical phenomena observed in the uni-
verse, with the aspiration that its ultimate findings may offer a framework for addressing the
Hubble tension.
The rest of this paper is as follows: In the Sec. II, we introduce the theoretical foundation
of how torsion influences the dynamical evolution of the universe. Then, Sec. III will focus
on the methods for numerical simulation and parameter constraints. At last, Sec. IV and
Sec. V will provide a brief analysis of the simulation results.

Theoretical foundation
2.1
Spacetime with torsion
In Einstein Cartan theory, torsion tensor is defined by anti-symmetric part of the affine
connection, as presented in Sa
bc = Γa
[bc]. As we always do, demanding metric tensor satisfy
– 2 –

the covariant condition as ∇cgab = 0. This result is oriented towards the following equation
of connection:
Γa
bc = ˜Γa
bc + Ka
bc.
(2.1)
First part gives Christoffel symbols, and the second part is contortion tensor which defined
as below:
Ka
bc = Sabc + Sbca + Scba = Sabc + 2S(bc)a,
(2.2)
where Sabc is torsion tensor. The equation Kabc = Ka[bc] leads to an interesting phenomenon:
the transformation of infinitesimal parallelograms is non-closing. From a physical perspective,
this implies that the decomposition can effectively characterize torsion, which is typically con-
sidered a manifestation of the endowed angular momentum of particle. The anti-symmetry of
Sabc guarantees it has only one independent tensor contraction, so we can make an intuitive
definition of anti-symmetric part of contortion tensor with its’ contraction:
Sa = Sb
ab = −Sb
ba ≡ϕ.
(2.3)
2.2
Field equations with torsion
In non-torsion spacetime, according to GR theory we can directly write the formula:
Rab −1
2Rgab = κTab −Λgab,
(2.4)
where Rab represents the Ricci tensor and R = Ra
a. This field equation follows the standard
form. Similarly, in Einstein-Cartan theory, the field equations may retain this form, but
the presence of torsion alters the expression of the Ricci tensor. In this theory, Rab and
Tab become anti-symmetric tensors. In Cartan field equations, the torsion tensor is typically
defined as:
Sabc = −1
4κ(2sbca + gcasb −gabsc),
(2.5)
where κ = 8πG and sabc represents the spin tensor of matter with sabc = s[ab]c , sa = sb
ab.
To satisfy the Bianchi identities, we can derive the following relationship between the Ricci
tensor and the torsion tensor under this condition through a series of calculations:
∇[eRab
cd] = 2Rab
f[eSf
cd],
(2.6)
and
Ra
[bcd] = −2∇[bSa
cd] + 4Sa
e[bSe
cd].
(2.7)
Next, by formulating a similar definition to the former Gab = Rab −1
2gabR, we can derive the
final corrected covariant derivative (This result has been proved in [6]) and we will find that
it does not satisfy the general relativistic conservation law ∇bGab = 0.
∇bGab = ∇bGba −2(∇2Sa −∇b∇aSb + ∇b∇cScba) −4∇b(ScScab).
(2.8)
2.3
Friedmann equation with torsion in FLRW metric
We first consider the metric associated with torsion. Using the expression Γa
bc = ˜Γa
(bc)+2S
a
bc
(which derived from Eqs. (2.1), (2.2)) and its transformation, we can compute the Christoffel
symbols with torsion from the torsion-free case. Due to the complexity of the specific metric
calculations, the results are provided in detail in the appendix at the end of the paper.
– 3 –

Similarly, we can still calculate the Ricci tensor using the following definition:
Rab = −∂bΓc
ac + ∂cΓc
ab −Γe
acΓc
eb + Γe
abΓc
ec.
(2.9)
Then, we assume that the energy-momentum tensor can be described by an perfect fluid
model,
Tab = ρuaub + pηab,
(2.10)
where uaua = −1 is time-like 4-velocity and ηab is Minkowski metric. Given the aforemen-
tioned conditions, we ultimately achieve the Friedmann equation:
( ˙a
a)2 = 1
3κρ −K
a2 + Λ
3 −4ϕ2 −4( ˙a
a)ϕ,
(2.11)
and acceleration equation with torsion:
¨a
a = −1
6κ(ρ + 3p) + Λ
3 −2 ˙ϕ −2( ˙a
a)ϕ.
(2.12)
Further, equation of state can be written as ρ = ωp, where ρ is energy density, p is pressure
and ω is state parameter. Then we can give the continuity equation by ∇aT ab = 0 as below:
˙ρ + 3(1 + ω)Hρ + 2(1 + 3ω)ϕρ = 4ϕ Λ
8πG.
(2.13)
2.4
Hubble parameter’s behavior under linear dependence to torsion field
In Eq. (2.3), we defined that anti-symmetric part of torsion tensor only have one independent
contraction. Therefore, we can give a further hypothesize its specific form of association with
other parameters from [17]. Here, we focus on a special form: ϕ(t) = −αH(t) where H = ˙a
a
is Hubble parameter, a is scale factor of universe and α is a constant which represents the
strength of torsion field.
Now, we can analyze the Friedmann equations under above conditions. The first step
is to dimensionless the continuity equation. Let ρ = xρ0, where x is dimensionless energy
density and ρ0 is the energy density ρ in the situation of a = 1. Then we can turn Eq. (2.13)
into:
˙x + 3(1 + ω)Hx + 2(1 + 3ω)ϕx = 4ϕ
Λ
8πGρ0
.
(2.14)
To simplify the calculation, we now define the present density parameters Ωm0 = 8πGρm0
3H2
0
and
ΩΛ0 =
Λ
3H2
0 , then the above equation change to:
dx
da + [3(1 + ω) −2α(1 + 3ω)]x
a + 4α ΩΛ0
Ωm0
= 0.
(2.15)
Integrating after separating the parameters gives:
x = a−C1(1 + C2
C1
) −C2
C1
,
(2.16)
where C1 = (3 −2α) + 3ω(1 −2α) and C2 = 4α ΩΛ0
Ωm0 .
Second, bringing the above assumption into acceleration equation, Eq. (2.12), it turns
to following form:
(1 −2α) ˙a
a
d˙a
da = H2
0[ΩΛ0 −(1 + 3ω)
2
Ωm0x].
(2.17)
– 4 –

Substitute the Eq. (2.16) into Eq. (2.17) and integrate by separating parameters. Sub-
sequently, we can give the expression of the Hubble parameter in terms of the parameters
which we aim to constrain:
H1(z) = (C3 −C4(1 + z)C1 + C5(1 + z)2)

(2.18)
where C3 =

H2
0 containing variable parameter H0, ΩΛ0, Ωm0, ω and α. However, the curvature density
parameter is of primary interest in this study and is not included among these parameters.
Therefore, we need to incorporate the simplified form of the first Friedman Eq. (2.14) into
the final expression as well:
H2(z) =
H0
|1 −2α|[((1 + z)C1(1 + C2

(2.19)
In the final numerical simulations, both formulas are components of the likelihood function.

Numerical methods
Now, we use the previously computed formulas Eqs. (2.18) and (2.19) to constrain these
parameters. The parameter constraint method used here is a common approach in cosmology
for performing analysis on data, which continues to be updated and developed to this day [18].
The reason for utilizing both formulas simultaneously in the simulation is that, in essence,
the two formulas are equivalent. And theoretically, starting from either should yield to the
same result. However, the former does not explicitly include the Ωk, which we require as a
variable in this context. Additionally, to maintain the stability of the MCMC process, we
incorporate both formulas in the simulation. In our simulations, the variables are the Hubble
parameter H and red-shift z, data sourced from [19], referred to as CC. At the end of this
section, Table. 1 is presented, compiling the specific CC reference data sources cited earlier
in the paper. This study employs the MCMC method for data handling, which combining
Monte Carlo methods with Markov chains.
The aforementioned method is employed here because the sample size of CC is very
small. We must increase the sample size, and the MCMC method is particularly well-suited
for this purpose as it can generate samples from the target distribution to meet our simulation
requirements. For convenience, a non-informative prior distribution is used here. This also
indicates that we do not overly rely on any specific assumptions or expectations during
the model construction process. The next step involves specifying the likelihood function.
Assuming the likelihood function to be normally distributed without loss of generality, then
by combining the two formulas provided above, we can derive the specific expression of the
likelihood function with the CC data:
ln(LH) =
Eqs.(2.18),(2.19)
X
j=1,2
(
n
X
i=1
−[Hobs,i −Hj(z)]2
2σ2
Hobs,i
),
(3.1)
where ln(LH) is log-likelihood function, Hobs, σHobs represent the actual observed values and
the standard deviation of the observed values of the Hubble parameter in CC and H(z)
represents the theoretical predicted value of the Hubble parameter at the current red-shift.
The parameters constraint in this study are performed using Python, utilizing the
MCMC computational capabilities of the Emcee package in [20].
Additionally, it should
– 5 –

be noted that the priors in this study include direct constraints on the curvature density pa-
rameter. The specific constraint range has been fine-tuned through a series of adjustments,
but is initially based on observational data from [21].
Now presenting the approximate
prior range used in the program: 1. Planck condition: A. 0 < H < 100 km s−1Mpc−1; B.
−0.1 < α < 0.1; C. −0.0012 < Ωk < 0.0026. 2. BBN condition: H and α limitation are
the same as Planck condition, except C. 0.02202 < Ωm(H/100)2 < 0.02268. There are two
reasons for applying different priors in this context. First, these various priors effectively
integrate constraints from a range of observational data and theoretical models, and testing
the stability of the model under these constraints is, in itself, a way to evaluate the validity
of the theory. Second, the use of direct constraints ensures that the parameter estimates
remain close to the stable value, rather than near the metastable state.

Results Analysis
4.1
Information from figures
In the initial case, we consider the case where ω = 0 and Ωk = 0 (which means curvature k =
0). We then examine the constraints imposed on the set of free parameters p = [H, α, ΩΛ, Ωm],
with particular emphasis on α and Ωm, as the stability of this model is determined by the
relationship between these two parameters. The stability is corroborated by the findings in
[37] as previous research.

Table. 1. This figure reflects the results of parameter constraints under the α = 0 and Ωk = 0
conditions. The unit of H is km s−1Mpc−1 and the same applies to the pictures that follow.
Next, we will discuss the details of each figure. In the following figures, the mean values
and their 1σ confidence intervals for the parameter constraints are indicated above the corner
plot, with the 1σ intervals shaded in light blue on the single-function plots. In the composite
plots, the dark blue regions represent the 1σ confidence intervals, while the light blue regions
represent the 2σ confidence intervals (95%c.l.).

parameter Ωk or torsion α. Fig. 2, compared to Fig. 1, only adds the Ωk. In the comparative
analysis in the later section, these two figures will serve as the zero-control, but for now, we

will refrain from further analysis or discussion of them.
The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the constraints on all parameters approx-
imately follow a normal distribution, with the exception of parameters α and Ωm, which
exhibit a notable linear relationship. This linearity is attributed to the constraints on baryon
density parameter Ωbh2 imposed by BBN. These findings suggest that the universe is stable
under this torsion field model.
Furthermore, when comparing our constrained results for the Hubble constant, H =
67.36+2.1
−2.7 km s−1Mpc−1, with the Planck 2018 observations H = 67.36 ± 0.54 km s−1Mpc−1
, we observe a close agreement between the two. This indicates that the model effectively
simulates the role of various components in the evolution of the universe.
For Fig. 4, we introduced the curvature density parameter Ωk as an additional variable,
and used BBN constraints on baryon density as a limiting condition. It is easy to find that

the linear relationship between α and Ωm nearly influences the constraint outcomes of all
parameters, particularly the composite images related to Ωk. This suggests that under this
model, the curvature density parameter is highly sensitive to variations in the torsion field.
Next, we turn to Fig. 5, where we utilize the Planck 2018 observations of parameter Ωk =
0.0007±0.0019 as a constraint. It is evident that, apart from the composite images associated
with Ωk, all results align consistently with Fig. 1. Upon examining the images related to
the curvature density parameter, it becomes apparent that variations in the strength of the
torsion field have minimal impact on the other parameters.
This observation does not contradict the findings from Fig. 4. Upon integrating the
results of Fig.
4 and Fig.
5, it appears that the strength of the torsion field and the
curvature density parameter may have a deeper underlying connection. The uncertainties
in the measurements of these two parameters may exhibit a product relationship akin to
Heisenberg uncertainty, warranting further investigation.

Results comparison and discussion
After a series of intuitive insights into the aforementioned figures, we now return to the
analysis of the physical framework.
It is well known that torsion and curvature are two
independent geometric parameters. In classical theory, curvature alone is sufficient to describe

the distortion of spacetime, whereas in EC theory, both torsion and curvature are required
for a complete description. Notably, due to the profound connection between torsion and
spin in EC theory, there has been a growing interest in identifying physical phenomena or
matter corresponding to torsion in actual observations, with dark matter being one of the
prominent candidates.
In this paper, we propose a hypothesis that the Hubble parameter is proportional to
the torsion, H = −αϕ, thereby linking the rate of cosmic expansion to geometric properties.
While this is not the first theoretical attempt to establish such a connection (as curvature
k has long been incorporated in the FLRW metric), torsion’s inherent asymmetry indirectly
influences the dynamical evolution of matter. This affects the large-scale structure of the
universe in a manner distinct from curvature, and directly influences the rate of cosmic
expansion. Therefore, the aforementioned proportionality assumption carries a certain degree
of theoretical justification.
To explore the relationship between various physical parameters in the figures, we ex-
amine several comparisons to identify their internal connections.
Let us first focus on the control group: Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, to determine the effect of the
presence or absence of the curvature parameter on the constraint results, without introducing
torsion. It is readily apparent that the two show almost no difference, and in Fig. 2, the joint
normal distribution of Ωk with respect to ΩΛ and Ωm is largely uncorrelated, indicating that
under general conditions, the curvature density parameter decouples from the other two.
To better assess the sensitivity of the original model to the curvature parameter and to
establish a more advanced control group for subsequent analysis, we add Ωk to the parameters
of the control group based on the previous setup. In Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, these figures illustrate
the differences between models with and without torsion, under the BBN constraint, in the

When excluding the images related to α, slight perturbations are
present, but the overall consistency remains. However, focusing on α, it shows a noticeable
correlation with other parameters, particularly exhibiting a positive linear relationship with
Ωm. This connection likely arises because α, as a potential physical representation of dark
matter, is part of the matter density parameter, thereby sharing the same increase-decrease
relationship.
Following the aforementioned approach, naturally, we allow Ωk to vary in order to as-
sess the simulation results for models with and without torsion under BBN constraints. This
comparison can be observed in Figures 2 and 4. It becomes evident that even when disre-
garding α-related images, the results are noticeably different from the comparison between
Fig. 1 and Fig. 3. The relationship between Ωk and ΩΛ and Ωm shifts to a negative linear
correlation, while the relationship between Ωm, H, and ΩΛ becomes positively correlated.
This anomaly likely arises because, in previous cases, the sum of the density parameters
equaled one, whereas the introduction of α causes the sum to deviate from one, and this
deviation is positively correlated with α. As a result, all density parameter relationships are
altered.
Moreover, it is not only the addition of Ωk that affects the parameter constraint results,
variations in the constraint conditions also lead to different outcomes. We compared Fig.
4 and Fig. 5 above to explore the differences in parameter trends under BBN and Planck
constraint conditions. Aside from the α-related images, the two are nearly identical. However,
in the case of α, the behavior of Ωm and ΩΛ shows opposite trends, and H exhibits almost
– 11 –

no response to changes in α. This inverse relationship is likely due to the limitations of
the constraint conditions themselves. For example, the BBN condition directly constrains
Ωm and H, making them dependent variables. According to the previous conclusions, α
shares the same increase-decrease relationship with the former, causing the sum of density
parameters to increase, with ΩΛ also positively correlated, consistent with the graphical
conclusions. However, under the Planck condition, such a relationship is not emphasized,
and since the value of Ωk is already small, the sum of density parameters remains close to
one, which narrows the reasonable range of α, ultimately leading the model to degenerate
into a result similar to that of Fig. 1.

Conclusions
In this paper, our primary work is to evaluate the plausibility of introducing torsion into the
ΛCDM model. By solving the ECKS equations, torsion is incorporated into the cosmological
dynamical evolution equations, specifically the Friedmann equations, in a manner corre-
sponding to spin. We apply Bayesian perspective supplemented with the MCMC method to
constrain the parameters of this model. The following conclusions can be drawn:
(1). Under the condition Ωk = 0 and with BBN constraints (Ωbh2 = 0.022353±0.00033),
we obtain H = 67.6+2.1
−2.7 km s−1Mpc−1 and α = 0.052+0.009
−0.007;
(2). Allowing Ωk to vary freely, with the same constraint in 1, we obtain H = 66.2+4.4
−2.9
km s−1Mpc−1, α = 0.061+0.024
−0.036 and Ωk = −0.13+0.54
−0.36;
(3). When changing the constraint condition to the Planck 2018 observational results
(Ωk = 0.0007 ± 0.0019), we get H = 68.8+2.9
−4.2 km s−1Mpc−1, α = −0.001+0.065
−0.101, and Ωk =
−0.07+0.49
−0.46.
It can be observed that the estimated values of the Hubble parameter and the associated
standard deviations under the three conditions show very little difference.
This is to be
expected, as current observational results suggest that both torsion and curvature density
parameters can only fluctuate around very small values. If the constraints in this study had
not constrained on these two parameters, the differences in the Hubble parameter estimates
would not be so small. However, the results for the parameter α, which represents torsion,
are distinct, showing correlations with the constraints themselves. Then, focusing on the
curvature density parameter Ωk, aside from case 1 where it is directly set to 0, all other
predictions for Ωk yield negative values.
This suggests that under this model, an open
universe with a hyperbolic spatial structure is more likely to appear.
Finally, let us return to the focus on the Hubble tension issue. It is evident that all the
obtained constraints on the Hubble parameter lie within the 1σ deviation range of the results
derived from CMB data (67.4 ± 0.5 km s−1 Mpc−1), while they do not include the results
obtained from direct measurements of Type Ia supernovae (73.04 ± 1.04 km s−1 Mpc−1).
This suggests that the theoretical framework of EC theory is more consistent with the former
observational results. Furthermore, the influence of Ωk on the Hubble tension introduces a
destabilizing factor to the model, which may be attributed to the physical connection between
spatial curvature and the torsion field. Taken together, these results emphasize the need for
further investigation into the interplay between torsion field and curvature in addressing the
Hubble tension.
In addition, the sensitivity of Ωk to the torsion field demonstrated in this paper indicates
that further precise measurements of the Ωk are crucial for studying the Hubble Tension.

Moreover, to improve the estimation accuracy of α and Ωk in this approach, more high-
precision observational data of the Hubble parameter are needed for parameter constraints.
