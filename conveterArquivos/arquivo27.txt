Abstract
Chlorine (Cl) is a chemical element of the group of the halogens and is between the 17th and
the 20th most abundant elements in the Solar System. It is thought to be produced from the
capture of a proton or neutron by specific alpha-element isotopes during both hydrostatic
and explosive oxygen burning, though some contribution may come from Type Ia super-
novae. Cl lines are quite rare in stellar spectra, so most of the information available about
its abundance comes from analyzing the emission lines of ionized nebulae, especially the
collisionally excited lines of Cl2+ ([Cl iii] λλ5518,5538). Our goal is to accurately determine
the Cl abundance in H ii regions, and gather more information about its nucleosynthetic
origin. For this work we used a sample of observations that encompasses the deepest spectra
of H ii regions available in the literature, from both the Milky Way and other galaxies in the
local Universe, covering a range of oxygen (O) abundances, 12+log(O/H), from 7.18 to 8.70.
As a first step, we determine the most representative electron temperature of the zone of the
nebulae where the Cl2+ ion lies. To this aim we used a grid of photoionization models and
diagnostics valid for other ions, as that parameter cannot be determined directly through
[Cl iii] lines. We then computed the total Cl abundance using different sets of ionization
correction factors to account for the contribution from unseen ionization stages.

Introduction
H ii regions are nebulae photoionized by the ultraviolet radiation from young, massive O-
and B-type stars, with effective temperatures ranging between 28,000 and 50,000 K. These
nebulae are key to understanding the present-day chemical composition of the interstellar
medium, shaped by stellar nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution. By studying

On the chlorine abundance in H ii regions
their emission line spectra, we can derive both the physical conditions of the gas —such as
electron density and temperature (ne, Te)— and the elemental abundances.
This study focuses on chlorine (Cl), a halogen group element, which is approximately the
17th most abundant element in the Solar System [1]. Cl is mainly analyzed in H ii regions,
because its spectral lines are extremely rare in stellar spectra, making nebular emission lines
the main source of abundance data. The [Cl iii] lines at 5517 and 5537 ˚A, the brightest Cl
lines in the optical range, are typically used to determine the Cl abundance.
Under typical nebular conditions, Cl2+ is the main contributor to the total Cl abundance,
with smaller contributions of Cl+ and Cl3+. The lines of these last two ions, such as [Cl ii]
λ9123 and [Cl iv] λ8046, are only detectable in the deepest spectra. In most cases, only
[Cl iii] lines are available, so ionization correction factors (ICFs) are needed to account for
the unseen ions. Additionally, the Te of the Cl2+ zone cannot be easily determined, so we
rely on temperature relations and diagnostics for other ions to estimate it. This is the main
aim of our study.

Photoionization models and observational sample
To achieve the objectives of this project, we used photoionization models to simulate the
spectra of H ii regions and compute their physical properties.
Specifically, we employed
the BOND photoionization model grid [9], available in the Mexican Million Models database
(3MdB) [8], and applied a series of constraints to select the most appropriate models for our
observational sample. The analysis of the model outputs was conducted using the PyNeb
package [6], which calculates ne, Te, and ionic abundances from the modeled spectra.
In addition to our primary goal, we aim to verify the applicability of certain temperature
relationships to observational data.
For this, a sample of 148 H ii regions and 120 star-
forming galaxies with detected [Cl iii] lines has been used.
This sample constitutes the
largest sample of ionized nebulae with reliable determinations of Cl abundances. We include
our own observations (see compilation in [7]) and additional high-quality spectra from the
literature. For each region, we reported line intensities and recomputed ne, Te and ionic and
elemental abundances.
To determine the Cl2+ abundance, we initially used Te(S2+), due to their similar ionization
potentials. However, when no [S iii] diagnostic lines are available, we used a temperature
relationship [3]. This brought us back to the models and our main goal: identifying a reliable
temperature relationship for Cl2+.
Instead of relying on S2+, we explored a relationship
between Te(Cl2+) and Te(O2+) and Te(N+) obtained from the models, chosen because the
ionization potential of Cl2+ is intermediate between to those of O2+ and N+, and Te(O2+)
is typically measured with high accuracy through the classical [O iii] λλ4959,5007λ4363 line
ratio in most H ii regions.

Temperature relationships
To derive the temperature relationship we are looking for, we used the photoionization model
grid to plot Te(Cl2+) against Te(O2+) and Te(N+), as shown in Figs. 1a and 1b, respectively.
The observed behavior is: N+, which represents regions with lower ionization, fits better at
lower temperatures, while O2+ provides a better fit in higher ionized regions.

(b) Te(N+)

The points are color-coded by its ionization degree. The red line is a linear fit to the points.
In the bottom panel, we show the values of the standard deviation, σ, to the fit in bins of
1 000 K. The mean value of σ is shown inside the red box.
The key conclusion from this analysis is that neither temperature seems to be appropriate
for the whole range of ionization degrees, leading us to propose a representative temperature
(Trep), defined as:
Trep = Te(N+) ·

1 −O2+
O

+ Te(O2+) · O2+
O
(1)
This captures the trend observed in Fig. 1: for lower ionization degrees, Te(N+) has more
weight, while Te(O2+) dominates at higher ionization. Re-plotting with this new temper-
ature yields Figure 2, which shows an improved behavior across ionization extremes and
a significantly reduced standard deviation. Henceforth, we will compare results from our
observational sample using this representative temperature.

Cl abundances
Once we have calculated the appropriate physical conditions, the next step is to complete the
chemical abundance analysis of our observational sample using PyNeb [6]. We started with
the determination of the Cl2+ ionic abundance. We then calculated the total Cl abundance
using two different ICF schemes [2, 4], one of which directly calculates the Cl/O ratio. This

ratio is of interest because, Cl and O are both thought to be formed in hydrostatic and
explosive oxygen burning in massive stars. Moreover, previous studies suggest that this ratio
should remain constant and close to the solar value [5].
We first plotted the Cl2+/O2+ ratio as a function of the ionization degree for our sample,
alongside the functions of the different ICFs, for both Te(S2+) and Trep (see Figs. 3a and 3b,
respectively). The results show that the ICF from [2] is valid across the full ionization range,
while the ICF proposed by [4] becomes applicable only when the ionization degree exceeds
0.2. However, at higher ionization degrees, the ICF of [4] fits the observational trend better,
while the ICF from [2] does not.
Finally, using the ICF equations, we calculated and plotted the Cl/O ratio as a function
of the ionization degree, resulting in the plots shown in Fig. 4. We observe that Trep tends to
reduce the data dispersion, and that the ICF from [4] gives smaller amplitudes in the Cl/O
variations as a function of ionization degree, except at the highest ionization degrees. The
peak on the right-hand side, more pronounced with Trep, could be due to the relationship
between the temperature and ionization degree. Using Te(S2+) introduces this dependence
when calculating the total Cl abundance, while Trep introduces it at the Cl2+ abundance
calculation stage, which might increase the dispersion in these points and, thus, the overall
dispersion of the mean value.
The key takeaway is that none of the combinations fully
eliminates the dependence on either temperature or ionization degree.

Preliminary conclusions and future work
The preliminary conclusions of this study are, first, that the proposed representative tem-
perature (Trep) is valid for representing the region where Cl2+ is located. Second, despite
our expectations, none of the combinations of ICF and temperature used in this analysis
completely eliminates the dependence on either temperature or ionization degree. Lastly,
and most importantly, as we will describe in detail in future publications, the results seem to
rule out significant contributions apart from the hydrostatic and explosive oxygen burning in
massive stars in the nucleosynthesis of chlorine.
As for next steps, we plan to further investigate the ionization degree dependence intro-
duced by the chosen temperature. Additionally, we are exploring alternative temperature
relationships applicable to other ions, which is a key focus of our ongoing work.
