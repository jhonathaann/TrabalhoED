ABSTRACT   
  
Purpose: This study investigates the efficacy of a multimodal machine learning framework in predicting treatment 
outcomes for intracranial aneurysms (IAs), focusing on how hemodynamic alterations captured through angiographic 
parametric imaging (API) are fused with detailed patient information and disease morphology from digital subtraction 
angiography (DSA). The research explores various data augmentation strategies to manage dataset imbalances, aiming 
to enhance the model's accuracy. By integrating deep learning with this comprehensive, fused dataset, the study seeks 
to significantly improve the precision and predictability of prognostic assessments for IAs.  
Materials and Methods: Data from 340 patients with treated intracranial aneurysms were analyzed using DSA. We 
utilized a multimodal approach, integrating quantitative and categorical data—ranging from angiographic parameters 
at the aneurysm dome to patient demographics like age, gender, and hypertension. Separate deep neural networks were 
trained for each data type. Pre-decision layers from these networks were concatenated and used as inputs to a final 
network designed to predict treatment outcomes. Additionally, different deep network architectures were tested for 
their ability to process and combine these data types effectively. To manage data imbalances, strategies such as random 
oversampling, undersampling, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous 
(SMOTE-NC) were implemented. The model's performance was evaluated through a 20-split Monte Carlo 
crossvalidation, focusing on metrics including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.  
Results: Our study indicates that augmenting multimodal predictive models for intracranial aneurysm outcomes with 
techniques like SMOTE/SMOTENC significantly enhances model performance. Intermediate fusion models, in 
particular, showed notable percentage improvements in predictive accuracy. The effectiveness of other augmentation 
methods varied, suggesting that the choice of technique is crucial for optimizing results.  
Conclusions:  This study validates the effectiveness of a multimodal machine learning framework in improving the 
accuracy of predicting treatment outcomes for intracranial aneurysms, with data augmentation techniques substantially 
enhancing model performance.  
  
  
Summary: This study evaluates a multimodal machine learning framework for predicting treatment outcomes in 
intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Combining angiographic parametric imaging (API), patient biomarkers, and disease 
morphology, the framework aims to enhance prognostic accuracy. Data from 340 patients were analyzed, with separate 
deep neural networks processing quantitative and categorical data. These networks' pre-decision layers were 
concatenated and inputted into a final predictive network. Various data augmentation strategies, including Synthetic 
Minority Over-sampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous data (SMOTE-NC), addressed dataset imbalances. 
Performance metrics, evaluated through Monte Carlo cross-validation, showed significant improvements with 
augmentation, particularly in intermediate fusion models. This study validates the framework's efficacy in accurately 
predicting IA treatment outcomes, demonstrating that data augmentation techniques can substantially enhance model 
performance.

1. BACKGROUND   
Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are vascular dilations of the arteries that can rupture and lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage 
(SAH), one of the most lethal types of strokes. Of those who survive SAH, 66% suffer permanent neurological deficits, 
underscoring the critical need for accurate diagnosis and management of IAs. [1, 2] Digital subtraction angiography 
(DSA) remains the standard imaging technique for IA assessment, evaluating both morphology and semiquantitative 
intra-aneurysmal flow. [3, 4]  Recently, enhancements in DSA have enabled angiographic parametric imaging (API), 
which provides detailed angioarchitecture and flow dynamics estimation by analyzing time-density curves (TDCs) at 
each pixel to derive parameters such as Mean Transit Time (MTT), Time to Peak (TTP), Peak Height (PH), and Area 
Under the TDC (AUC). [5, 6] These parameters are important for analyzing flow dynamics in IAs and evaluating 
changes post-treatment.  
API parameters, when analyzed using deep learning techniques, have demonstrated a significant correlation with 
treatment outcomes of IAs, achieving accuracy levels around 0.8. [7] However, there is potential to further enhance 
these predictive models. In clinical practice, physicians consider a variety of factors beyond API parameters, such as 
social factors and aneurysm morphology, which are important in assessing the progression of healing after 
endovascular surgery. To replicate this multifaceted decision-making process, our study extends the deep learning 
model to incorporate these additional variables. By employing late and intermediate fusion techniques in multimodal 
machine learning, we integrate diverse data types, including biomarkers, morphological details, and patient 
demographic information alongside API parameters. This comprehensive data integration aims to mimic the complex 
analysis typically performed by clinicians and is expected to significantly improve the precision of the predictive 
models, providing a more holistic approach to predicting treatment outcomes.  
  
This study employs deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers to explore how different fusion strategies affect 
the predictive accuracy of IA treatment outcomes, particularly occlusion. Furthermore, considering the imbalanced 
nature of clinical data, where successfully treated cases far outnumber failures, data augmentation techniques such as 
oversampling have been implemented. These methods are crucial for training robust models that can generalize well 
across real-world datasets. By comparing the effectiveness of late and early fusion methods, both with and without 
oversampling, this research aims to refine predictive algorithms that support better clinical decisions in the treatment 
of IAs.  
  
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS    
2.1 Data Collection   
In this study, patient data collection and subsequent analysis procedures adhered strictly to the protocols approved by 
the Institutional Review Board at the University at Buffalo, ensuring compliance with ethical standards. We gathered 
retrospective data from 340 patients who underwent treatment for IAs at the Gates Vascular Institute. These patients 
were treated using advanced pipeline embolization devices (PED) or coil technologies, with each case having a 
minimum follow-up period of six months post-treatment to monitor and assess long-term outcomes.  
  
Firstly, we assembled a biomarker dataset incorporating key patient demographics such as age, gender, and race, 
alongside critical clinical history variables including smoking status, presence of diabetes, hypertension, subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (SAH) history, body mass index (BMI), and family history of aneurysm. These factors are essential as 
they can influence both the development and treatment outcomes of intracranial aneurysms. Secondly, our morphology 
dataset included detailed anatomical data on the aneurysms. This dataset detailed the specific types of aneurysms 
encountered, such as Cavernous, PCOM (Posterior Communicating Artery), SHA (Superior Hypophyseal Artery), 
Paraophthalmic, Paraclinoid, Supraclinoid, Petrous, Ophthalmic, PCA (Posterior Cerebral Artery), Dorsal, Cervical, 
Petrocavernous, Terminus, PICA (Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery), and Parasellar. Each type has distinct 
characteristics that affect treatment strategy and prognosis. Additional data on the aneurysm's physical dimensions, 
including type, size, the length of the proximal and distal artery segments, and the ratio of the aneurysm dome to neck, 
were also recorded to better understand their structural implications on blood flow and rupture risk. Lastly, our API 
dataset, derived from DSA sequences, included parameters such as MTT, TTP, PH, AUC and other relevant API 
measures. These parameters, obtained from DSAs performed during optimal visualization of the aneurysm dome, 

provide insights into the blood flow dynamics within the aneurysm, which are critical for predicting rupture risk and 
planning treatment.  
  
For API data processing, we utilized the QAS.AI Parametric Imaging program (QAS.AI Inc., Buffalo, NY), which 
facilitated the generation of API maps from DICOM images. We ensured accuracy in our measurements by averaging 
API feature values within delineated Regions of Interest (ROI) and by manually contouring the aneurysm boundaries. 
Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of our data against variability in clinical practice, we implemented a two-step 
normalization method, as proposed by Ionita et al., which was designed to reduce dependency on factors such as 
injection variability—often influenced by the neurosurgeon’s technique—and to adjust for foreshortening effects, 
where the angiogram's contrast intensity correlates with the length of the X-ray pathway through the anatomical 
structures.  
  
2.2 Data fusion  
In this study, predictive models are developed using advanced machine learning techniques to forecast the outcomes 
of intracranial aneurysm treatments. Data preprocessing involves normalizing both numerical and categorical data to 
ensure that the inputs for model training are clean and standardized. The first model uses a late fusion approach. The 
architecture is built using TensorFlow's Keras API. The models consist of multiple deep neural networks that each 
handle different types of data—such as patient demographics, clinical history, and angiographic parameters—to 
capture a comprehensive range of features. Each neural network comprises several layers: the input layer is followed 
by dense layers that use 'LeakyReLU' activation functions for non-linear processing and 'he_normal' as the kernel 
initializer, which are particularly effective for models with relu and similar activations. Regularization is applied to 
each layer using L1L2 regularizers to mitigate the risk of overfitting. These networks are then trained to process their 
respective datasets independently before their outputs are combined. The concatenation of features occurs after the 
initial individual networks have processed their inputs, allowing the model to integrate diverse data streams effectively. 
This concatenated output then passes through additional dense layers with 'LeakyReLU' activations to further refine 
the feature integration, enhancing the model's ability to discern complex patterns across different data types. The final 
layer of the combined model is a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function, designed to output the probability of 
treatment success. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, with a learning rate carefully set to optimize 
convergence. The loss function used is binary crossentropy, appropriate for binary classification tasks. Training 
involves various techniques to optimize model performance, including early stopping to prevent overtraining, model 
checkpointing to save the best model during training, and a learning rate reduction strategy that adjusts the learning 
rate when the model's improvement plateaus.  
  
The second model uses an intermediate fusion approach. In this model, preprocessing tasks are streamlined through 
an advanced pipeline setup, which standardizes numerical features and converts categorical variables using one-hot 
encoding, ensuring all input data forms are uniformly processed for model training. Unlike the initial model, this 
refined approach emphasizes more on concatenating features from various data streams at different stages. Here, each 
feature set derived from individual data sources—such as demographic, clinical, and imaging data—is initially 
processed through its own dedicated neural network path. These paths include dense layers with configurations tailored 
to the type of data they process, utilizing activation functions and regularizers designed for optimal performance per 
data type. After processing, features from these paths are concatenated to form a unified feature set, which then feeds 
into additional dense layers. This setup allows for a layering strategy where concatenated outputs pass through further 
neural network layers, enhancing the model's ability to learn complex patterns across combined datasets. Each layer 
in this architecture is designed to contribute uniquely to handling specific data characteristics before merging, which 
contrasts with the earlier model where feature integration occurred earlier in the process. This model employs an Adam 
optimizer like the first, but adjustments in learning rate strategies and the addition of learning rate reduction on plateaus 
cater to the specifics of the concatenated model, optimizing training efficiency and model accuracy.  
  
For both approaches, we employed early stopping and checkpointing strategies, ensuring that the best model 
configuration is saved, and overfitting is minimized during training. Overall, both models represent an integrated and 
data-specific approach to handling diverse datasets, improving upon the unimodal methods, introducing a more 
complex and finely tuned architecture designed to better mimic clinical decision-making processes.  
  

2.3 Imbalanced data handling  
In our study, integrating extensive datasets featuring patient characteristics and disease morphology alongside 
traditional imaging data revealed a significant challenge due to increased problem dimensionality and data complexity. 
This integration resulted in decreased accuracy of the predictive models due to the exacerbated class imbalances 
introduced by diverse categorical and binary data types. To address this, we employed several data augmentation 
strategies to balance our dataset and improve model performance. Specifically, we utilized Synthetic Minority 
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and its extension SMOTE for Nominal Continuous data (SMOTENC). SMOTE 
helps by synthesizing new examples from the minority class based on existing samples, effectively increasing the 
representation of under-represented classes in our dataset. SMOTENC adapts this approach to handle mixed data types 
(both continuous and categorical features) which are prevalent in our datasets due to the inclusion of varied patient 
demographics and aneurysm characteristics. Additionally, we applied RandomOverSampler to simply duplicate 
instances of the minority class, aiming for a straightforward increase in their frequency to achieve a more balanced 
dataset. Furthermore, Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) was used to generate synthetic data focusing more on 
those regions where the classifier performed poorly. ADASYN adjusts the synthetic sample generation by creating 
more samples in areas where the model has difficulty learning, thereby improving the overall model training phase.  
  
3. RESULTS   
  
In evaluating our predictive models for intracranial aneurysm treatment outcomes, the unimodal approach achieved 
an AUROC of 0.74±0.07, indicating fair accuracy without augmentation. When employing multimodal fusion 
techniques, the initial performance was lower (AUROC of 0.68±0.1 for both late and intermediate fusion). However, 
augmentations such as SMOTE/SMOTENC improved the late fusion model's AUROC to 0.73±0.04 and significantly 
enhanced the intermediate fusion model to 0.85±0.06, the highest observed performance. The effects of 
RandomOverSampler and ADASYN varied, with intermediate fusion showing notable declines or moderate 
improvements (AUROC ranging from 0.52±0.07 to 0.79±0.1), emphasizing that the effectiveness of augmentation 
strategies can depend heavily on the model structure and data integration approach.  
  

  
  
Figure 1. Intermediate fusion model architecture. This architecture is designed to integrate highly-variable datasets, 
including patient characteristics, disease morphology, and traditional imaging data. This approach aims to enhance 
predictive model performance despite the increased dimensionality and data complexity. The architecture consists of 
multiple preprocessing steps, including standardization of numerical features and one-hot encoding of categorical 
variables, followed by data augmentation techniques such as SMOTE, SMOTENC, random oversampling, and 
ADASYN to address class imbalance.  
  
  
4. CONCLUSION   
This study demonstrated the effectiveness of a multimodal machine learning framework in predicting treatment 
outcomes for IAs, emphasizing the integration of hemodynamic data with detailed patient information and aneurysm 
morphology. By applying advanced data augmentation strategies, such as SMOTE/SMOTENC, we significantly 
improved the precision and predictability of the models. Notably, the use of intermediate fusion techniques coupled 
with strategic data augmentation resulted in substantial improvements in model accuracy, as evidenced by increases 
in AUROC values. These findings highlight the potential of combining various data types and sophisticated machine 
learning techniques to enhance diagnostic tools in a clinical setting. The variability in performance across different 
augmentation methods also underscores the necessity for careful selection and application of these techniques based 
on specific model requirements and data characteristics. Moving forward, these insights could guide the development 
of more refined AI-driven diagnostic and prognostic tools, ultimately contributing to better patient management and 
treatment outcomes in the field of neurovascular medicine.
