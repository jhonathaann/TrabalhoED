Abstract. The discrepancy between the Hubble constant H0 values derived from early-
time and late-time measurements, reaching up to 4σ, represents the most serious challenge
in modern cosmology and astrophysics.
In this work, we investigate if a similar tension
exists between only late time measurements at different redshifts. We use the latest public
datasets including Cosmic Chronometers, Megamasers, SNe Ia and DESI-BAO, that span
from redshift z ∼0 up to z ∼2.3. By dividing the data into redshift bins, we derive H0 values
from each bin separately. Our analysis reveals a phenomenological dynamic evolution in H0
across different redshift ranges, with a significance from 1.5σ and 2.3σ, depending on the
parameterization. Consistency of the model demands observational constancy of H0 since it
is an integration constant within the Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric.
Thus, these findings suggest that the observed Hubble tension might not only exist between
early and late-time measurements but also among late-time data themselves, providing new
insights into the nature of the Hubble tension.

Introduction
Our current understanding of the Universe relies on the ΛCDM model which incorporates
the cosmological constant Λ and a cold dark matter component. This model is the most
accepted and successful in explaining most cosmological observations [1, 2]. One of the most
important challenges within the astrophysics and cosmology community is the discrepancy
of more than 4σ for the Hubble constant H0, between local measurements using the cosmic
distance ladder and early-time measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
The former based on direct observations of Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) calibrated with
Cepheids by the SH0ES team [3] and the latter obtained by the Planck satellite, which relies
on the ΛCDM model [1]. This so called Hubble tension has led to an exhaustive search for
potential explanations. A wide range of models have been used to address the H0 tension,
proposing either a dark energy (DE) component during the early evolution of the Universe
[4–9], a DE component with a time-varying equation of state [10–12], extra interactions
between the components of the Universe [13–16], or modified gravity [17–19]. For a more
comprehensive study about the H0 tension and alternative proposals, see the reviews [20–22].
In the ΛCDM model, H0 is a constant by definition: it represents the Hubble parameter
H(z) at the present epoch H0 = H(z = 0). However, recent results have shown that H0
depends on the redshift of the probes used to determine it. The first of these results, from
six gravitationally lensed quasars with measured time delays by the H0LiCOW program,
indicated that H0 decreases with lens redshift [23], with no evidence suggesting that this
trend is due to unaccounted systematics [24]. Subsequent studies have found a similar feature
in different datasets [25–34], offering a new perspective on the Hubble tension due to an
apparent redshift dependence of a quantity that should, tautologically, be a constant.
Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration published its
cosmological constraints from the first year of observations of baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO). The results favor models with a DE component whose equation of state varies with
time by more than 2.6σ [35], which challenges the paradigm of what we previously believed
to be correct in the ΛCDM model. This dynamical DE could be responsible for a H0 that
depends on redshift.
– 1 –

Ref. [25] found that splitting cosmological data in different redshift bins up to z = 0.7
gives different estimates to H0 which are in contradiction with a single constant H0 at 2.1σ
level. Leading to the conclusion that the Hubble tension is present even between late time
measurements themselves when taken at different redshifts. Ref. [25] assumed a cosmological
constant and used BAO-BOSS data [2]. The new DESI results lead us to question whether
the new data together with a dynamical DE could solve this tension.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we detail the implemented methodology,
along with the theory behind the cosmological probes used in this paper. In section 3, we
mention the data used. In section 4, we explain the criteria used to split the data into bins.
In section 5, we present our results on constraining the value of H0 in each of the bins.
Finally, the summary and conclusions can be found in section 6.

Cosmology
In light of the new discoveries for the first cosmological results from DESI [35], in this work
we use a flat Universe with a dynamical Dark Energy component, with a Chevallier-Polarski-
Linder (CPL) equation of state given by w(a) = w0 + wa(1 −a) [36, 37]. The Friedmann
equation is given by the following parameterization
H(z) = H0

Ωm(1 + z)3 + (1 −Ωm)f(z)
1/2 ,
(2.1)
where
f(z) = (1 + z)3(1+w0+wa)e−3waz/(1+z),
(2.2)
and with H0, Ωm, w0, wa the free parameters.
Following [25], we will split different cosmological data according to their redshift in order
to estimate the Hubble constant using only data in certain redshift ranges. This method
involves binning a modern dataset that includes the new DESI data, cosmic chronometers
(CC), megamasers, and SNe Ia samples.
The SNe Ia samples comprises the Pantheon+
compilation, and the new Union3 compilation and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 data
release. With this new data we were able to expand the redshift range in the analysis to
observe in more depth the evolution of H0 with the redshift of the data.
Cosmic chronometers provide a direct estimate of the expansion rate of the Universe.
This method takes advantage of the fact that the Hubble parameter, H(z), can be directly
expressed as a function of the time differential of the Universe, dt, over a given redshift
interval, dz [38]
H(z) = −
1
1 + z
dz
dt .
(2.3)
CCs evolve homogeneously as a function of cosmic time and on a timescale much longer than
their age difference. Given H(z), to obtain H0 from eq. (2.1) it is necessary to determine
Ωm, w0, wa from other observations.
The water megamasers found in the accretion disks of supermassive black holes in active
galactic nuclei (AGN) act like a laser beam in the microwave band, providing a method to
calculate extragalactic distances without relying on the cosmic distance ladder [39]. The
disk model returns an estimation of the angular diameter distance ˆDA to the galaxy and its
recession velocity ˆvi. The decomposition of this velocity between its peculiar and cosmological
components ˆvi = vpec,i + czi is unknown for objects this close. Each ˆDA is related to its
– 2 –

expected redshift zi and the cosmological parameters by the equation
DA(z) =
c
1 + z
Z z
0
dz′
H(z′).
(2.4)
Following [40], we take peculiar velocities of the galaxies into account incorporating σpec =
250 km s−1 into the velocity uncertainties. The chi-squared used to constrain cosmological
parameters is then given as
χ2 =
N
X
i=1
"
(vi −ˆvi)2
σ2
v,i + σ2pec
+ (DA(vi/c) −ˆDi)2
σ2
D,i
#
,
(2.5)
where the expected cosmological recession velocities are given by vi = czi, N the number
of data, σv,i is the statistical uncertainty in the velocity measurement ˆvi, and σD,i is the
standard deviation of the distance measurement ˆDi. We take the expected velocities vi for
megamaser host galaxies as nuisance parameters.
The SNe Ia data gives the apparent magnitude mb of each SNe, which can be compared
with the predicted model given by
mb = M + µ(z) = M + 25 + 5log10
DL(z)
Mpc

,
(2.6)
where M is the absolute magnitude for SNe Ia, and DL(z) is the luminosity distance, which
in the case of SNe Ia can be written, according to [41], by
DL(z) = (1 + zhel)(1 + zcmb)DA(zcmb),
(2.7)
zhel is the heliocentric redshift of the SNe (or its host galaxy) and zcmb is this redshift corrected
for the peculiar motion of the solar system with respect to the CMB. Note that the parameters
M and H0 are degenerate when analyzing SNe alone. Therefore, SNe measurements are used
to constrain other cosmological parameters, particularly the matter density Ωm.
The BAO measurements provide distances relative to the sound horizon, rd, as a function
of redshift [2]. Along the line-of-sight direction, a measurement of the redshift interval, ∆z,
gives a means to measure the Hubble distance at redshift z,
DH(z) =
c
H(z).
(2.8)
Along the transverse direction, measuring the angle ∆θ subtended by the BAO feature at z
estimates the comoving angular diameter distance, DM(z)
DM(z) = (1 + z)DA(z),
(2.9)
These measurements can also be summarized by a single estimation representing the spheri-
cally averaged distance
DV(z) =

zD2
M(z)DH(z)
1/3 ,
(2.10)
BAO measurements constrain these distances all divided by the sound horizon rd. Therefore,
H0 and rd are degenerated with each other. The BAO measurements constraint the product
H0rd, and therefore are key in the treatment of Hubble tension. This constraint implies that
a higher H0, as that obtained by SH0ES [3], requires a lower rd, which is incompatible with
the value inferred by the Planck Collaboration [1]. In this work we won’t use the CMB prior
on rd as this will imply the use of data outside our redshift bins.

Data
To constrain H0, we use the following public data up to the redshift z < 2.33, including
their systematic errors and covariance matrices. These data correspond to the latest public
measurements of the observables from the previous section:
I. Distances and recession velocities from 6 megamasers in the range 0.002 ≤z ≤0.034,
from the Megamaser Cosmology Project [39, 40, 42].
II. 32 cosmic chronometers data in the range 0.07 ≤z ≤2, from refs. [43–51]. We estimate
the covariance matrix1 between these data points following ref. [52].
III. BAO measurements in galaxy, quasar and Lyman-α forest tracers from the Year 1 data
release of DESI. These are measurements of the transverse comoving distance DM and
Hubble rate DH, or their combination DV, relative to the sound horizon rd with the
following effective redshifts zeff = 0.30, 0.51, 0.71, 0.93, 1.32, 1.49, 2.33 [35].
IV. For the superenovae type Ia measurements, we use any of the three latest compilations.
1,590 SNe Ia from the Pantheon+ compilation in the redshift range 0.01 ≤z ≤2.26
[53]. Recently published results from the Year 5 data release of the Dark Energy Survey
(DES Y5) that include 1,635 new photometrically classified SNe Ia and 194 low-redshift
SNe Ia (which are also in common with Pantheon+), spanning 0.025 ≤z ≤1.3 [54].
Finally, 22 binned data points from 2087 SNe Ia from the Union3 sample in the range
0.05 ≤z ≤2.26 [55], which has 1360 SNe in common with Pantheon+. We include
both the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the three sets. We emphasize that
these SNe Ia data are not independent of each other, and therefore, we cannot combine
them. However, they differ in the way they analyze systematic errors and astrophysical
parameters, making it interesting to compare the results of each of them.
Compared with the data used in ref. [25] which includes the BOSS BAO data [2] and
the Pantheon sample [56], we have the BAO data from DESI Y1, the recent supernovae
compilations Pantheon+, Union3 and DES Y5, as well as three extra measurements of CC.
Since the Pantheon+, DES and Union3 data cannot be combined, we present each of their
results separately. The analyses always include the megamasers+CC+DESI data, which we
will call “Base”, but differ in the SNe sample. We denote each case as Base+PantheonPlus,
Base+Union3 and Base+DES.

Fitting
In this section, we describe how we fit the cosmological parameters using the data specified
in the last section. Our objective is to see if the estimation of the Hubble constant H0 is
consistent when using data at different redshifts. We will split the total redshift range from
our data in separate redshift bins with z ∈(zi
min, zi
max) and we use only data coming from
that bin to estimate H0.
The redshift width of the bins varies between each other as we follow the strategy used in
[25] requiring that the average redshift of each bin coincides between megamasers, SNe and

the condition (4.1) leads to different binnings and different ¯z’s depending on the SNe’s used
(PantheonPlus, Union3 and DES).

Table 2: Numerical values for the best-fit H0 in each bin and for each data set. To see the redshift range
of each of the bins refer to table 1. This data is plotted in fig. 1.
To fit the parameters, we used the Python module emcee [57]. We set flat priors for all the
parameters, in particular for H0 the prior is large enough that its fitting is mainly influenced
by the measurements
H0 ∈(0, 150).
(4.2)
On the other hand, the data contained in a single bin lack the power to constrain the
equation of state parameters w0 and wa. Therefore the posteriors of these parameters are
mainly influenced by their priors. We considered large prior ranges
wa ∈(−2.5, 2.5), w0 ∈(−1.5, −1/3),
(4.3)
to allow for enough freedom in the DE dynamics.
These ranges contain both the DESI
estimation2 and the cosmological constant w0 = −1, wa = 0. After we fit the parameters, w0
and wa take values in their entire allowed region without preference for a particular value.
This comes from the narrow ranges in z for each bin which limit the evolution of f(z) in
equation (2.2) and therefore the possible observable effects from a dynamical Dark Energy.
In subsection 5.3 we do find limits for w0 and wa using the full redshift range of the data.
Not all bins fit all parameters due to the fact that each bin may or may not contain a
certain type of data. The only parameters fitted in all bins are Ωm, H0, w0, wa, and the
absolute magnitude of SNe Ia M.

Results
We show the fitted values of H0 for each bin in Table 2 and illustrate them in figure 1. In
all three analyses, H0 decreases as function of redshift for z < 0.6, which agrees with [25].
In the next two bins, the value of H0 increases to a maximum of ∼78 km s−1 Mpc−1 and
then decreases again. Note that the scarcity and low quality of data inflate the errors at high
redshifts.
In figure 1 we see that the estimations in H0 seem to depend on the redshift. In order
to quantify how much this measurements deviate from a constant, we introduce different
parameterizations
eH0(¯z, θk) ,
(5.1)
that are functions of the redshift of the measurements ¯z and some parameters θk for k =
1, 2, · · · which allow eH0 to deviate from a constant. Assuming statistical independence we

Base+PantheonPlus and ¯zi + 0.03 for Base+Union3. The centers of the bins ¯zi differ for each data set due
to eq. (4.1). The green horizontal band corresponds to the value from SH0ES [3] (H0 = 73.04 ± 1.04 km
s−1Mpc−1) and the light red horizontal band corresponds to the value from Planck 2018 [1] within a ΛCDM
scenario (H0 = 67.4 ± 0.5 km s−1Mpc−1).

(5.2)
where the posteriors Pi result from the fits of each of the bins. With this, we fit the parameters
θk and estimate how much eH0 deviates from a constant.
We evaluate how statistically significant is the deviation from a constant H0 by using
three different methods. First, we use the Bayesian evidence given by [58]
E =
Z
Π(θk)L(θk)dθk ,
(5.3)
where Π is the prior and L the Likelihood of the parameters θk. We compute the integral
using the nested integration algorithm Polychord [59, 60]. Here a larger value means a model
with more probability. We report the Bayes factor given by
B = Evar
Econs
(5.4)
and use it to determine if either the variable model or the constant is favored by the data.
Secondly, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) defined as [61, 62]
AIC = −2 log Lmax + 2k,
(5.5)
where Lmax is the maximum likelihood that can be obtained within the model and k the
number of free parameters.
Between the two models, the variable and the constant, the
– 7 –

one with the smaller AIC value is preferred by the data. This criterion favors the larger
Lmax but penalizes too many extra parameters. In the next subsections we report ∆AIC =
AICvar −AICcons.
Thirdly, we determine the number of standard deviations (σ) away from a constant. For
parameterizations with a single extra parameter we only divide the distance to a constant
by the standard deviation of the parameter. For models with more parameters, we compute
the p-value of the variable model and, assuming a Gaussian distribution, we determine the
number of standard deviations associated with that p-value. This is the least rigorous of our
tests, but serves to communicate the relevance of our results as the cosmological community
is familiar with the concept that a few σ’s can be the result of statistical fluctuations and
not a physical effect.
5.1
Quadratic parameterization
The first 6 bins in figure 1 seem to indicate a quadratic behaviour, therefore we propose a
quadratic parameterization of the form
eH0(z) = ˆH0 + mz + bz2,
(5.6)
with parameters ˆH0, m and b. For the fit, we exclude the results for bins 7 and 8 in order to
avoid biases caused by the abrupt drop in the value of H0 in bin 7, and the large error bars
in bin 8.
The results are shown in table 3 and in figure ??, which displays the best fit to this
quadratic function. We also drew the 2.3, 16, 84 and 97.7 percentiles of the fitted samples
as a function of redshift to represent the 1σ and 2σ errors.
From the table 3 we can see that the parameters m and b deviate from zero, favouring a
non constant H0 model. The values of the Bayes factor and the ∆AIC however, show that
this parametrization improves very modestly the fit to the data given by the constant H0.
Only accounting for a barely worth mentioning result according to the Jeffreys’ scale [63] of
the Bayes factor. And according to the ∆AIC scale in [62] corresponding to no preference
between the models.
It is evident that the low values of H0 in the last two bins can lead to a fitting which is
compatible with a constant H0 (m = 0 and b = 0). This can be considered a limitation of
the quadratic parameterization, which asks for H0 to grow up to infinity at large redshifts.
As this parameterization is purely phenomenological, we change it for one that won’t present
this behaviour in the next subsection.
5.2
Fourier parameterization
If we consider all the bins in figure 1, we see a possible oscillatory behavior. Therefore, we
follow ref. [64] by proposing a parameterization in terms of the Fourier series
eH0(z, bk, ck) = ˆH0 +
X
k
[bk sin(2kπa) + ck cos(2kπa)] ,
(5.7)
where a = 1/(1 + z) is the scale factor. After fitting different cuts of the series, we have
obtained that the second term in the cosine series c2 follows the oscillatory trend particularly
well. In order to simplify the parameterization we stay with
eH0(z) = ˆH0 + A cos(4πa).

Base+PantheonPlus and Base+Union3 reach up to z = 2.3 while Base+DES only up to z = 1.13.
We
compared the model to a constant H0 and determine the Bayes factor B, ∆AIC and σ deviation. We see that
the deviation from a constant is larger in σ’s than for the quadratic model. The ∆AIC is slightly better for
the Fourier model than for a constant, although from the scale in [62] there is no preference to either model.
The Bayes factors values account for a barely worth mentioning value according to the Jeffreys’ scale [63],
with the exception of the Base+DES data, which shows a substantial preference for the non constant model.
with only the two parameters ˆH0 and A.
We now fit all the available bins showing the results in table 4. Figure ?? displays the fit
for the 8 bins in the Base+PantheonPlus and Base+Union3 samples, and for only 6 bins in
the Base+DES sample, remembering this data set has a reduced redshift range.
Again, table 4 includes the σ, ∆AIC and B values to see the robustness of this model
against a constant H0. The parameter A is different from zero up to ∼2.3 standard devia-
tions, suggesting a preference for the non constant model. However, the scale in [62] states
that the difference in AIC values is insufficient to favor any of the models. Table 4 also
contains the results in each data set for only 6 bins, confirming a general improvement over
the quadratic parameterization. On Jeffreys’ scale [63], the Bayes factors in table 4 account
for a barely worth mentioning value, with the exception of the Base+DES sample, where we
found a substantial preference for the non constant model. It is interesting to note that the
latest two bins in Base+PantheonPlus and Base+Union3 don’t change too much the results
in each data set compared to 6 bins.

Unbinned results
In Table 5 we show the fitted values of the cosmological parameters using the full redshift
range of the data. For the Hubble constant we obtain an intermediate value between CMB
and SH0ES of H0 ≈70 km s−1Mpc−1, see figure 4. The constraints on w0 and wa are in
good agreement with those found for DESI+SNe in [35]. Table 5 shows that a cosmological
constant Λ (corresponding to w0 = −1 and wa = 0) as a source of DE is excluded at ap-
proximately 2σ with Base+Union3 and Base+DES data, while Base+PantheonPlus excludes
it at approximately 1σ. Moreover, Ωm agrees with the Planck value, Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.007;
however, the sound horizon rd disagrees with the Planck value, rd = 147.09 ± 0.26, by about
1.5σ.

dataset, without binning and over the entire redshift range z < 2.33. Without the CC and megamasers data,
H0, rd and M cannot be determined. We see that the constraints on w0 and wa resemble those in [35], for
DESI + SNe data. A cosmological constant (w0 = −1 and wa = 0) is excluded by ∼2σ when the SNe data
are either Union3 or DES.

Summary and conclusions
In this work, we have studied the evolution in the value of H0 with the redshift of the data
used to determine it, finding a dynamic evolution in H0. For that we used the latest dataset
of CC, megamaser, SNe Ia and BAO observations from the Year 1 data release of DESI. The
results show that the Hubble tension, referring to a phenomenologically non-constant value
in H0, cannot be resolved by the new DESI data together with a dynamical DE.
The SNe observations are chosen from one of the three most recent samples of Pantheon+,
Union3 and DES. Pantheon+ and Union 3 share about 1360 SNe but differ in their analysis
and treatment over systematics. DES has 1635 new SNe but share 194 low redshift SNe with
Pantheon+. Our three data samples share the megamasers+CC+DESI data but differ in the
SNe data. Base+PantheonPlus and Base+Union3 formed a total of 8 bins, and 6 bins for
Base+DES.
If we consider only the first 6 bins, we found (see fig. 1), for the three samples, that H0
decreases as a function of redshift for z < 0.5, and then rises in the region 0.5 < z < 0.9 up
to ∼78 km s−1Mpc−1. In fact, if we include bins 7 and 8, the dynamic trend becomes more
robust, with H0 decreasing again for these bins.
– 11 –

The results show a dynamical trend in H0 with a statistical significance up to 1.5σ, for
the quadratic parameterization (5.6) and up to 2.3σ for the Fourier parameterization (5.8),
indicating a preference for a non constant model. However, the values in ∆AIC and the
Bayes factor B, which penalize the extra parameters in the dynamical models, do not provide
substantial support for the quadratic function against a constant value. From a Bayesian
point of view, both the quadratic function and a constant H0 fit the bins results equally well.
Similar conclusions are obtained for the Fourier parameterization, except for the results of
Base+DES, which have the highest ∆AIC and B values showing a substantial preference for
the dynamical model, according to the Jeffrey’s scale.
Remarkably, the value of eH0(z = 0) for both models, as shown in tables 3 and 4, is in
complete agreement with that obtained by SH0ES, H0 = 73.04 ± 1.04 km s−1Mpc−1.
We highlight that the three data sets, which use different SNe samples, show similar
behaviors even though each sample differs in its content and methodology. Because of this,
we can infer that this trend is not caused by uncountable systematic errors in the SNe
parameters and it is more of an intrinsic behavior guided by the data.
We have ignored any calibration on either rd or M. However, if we adopt them, we find
that the bins values of H0 are completely consistent with a constant. This would require
to use data outside of the redshift bin, either CMB data to determine rd or distance leader
data to determine M. As fixing rd or M is equivalent to fixing H0 from the beginning, which
prevents the data from speaking for itself. It is relevant to highlight that any solution to the
Hubble tension that only modifies the calibration of rd or M won’t solve the tension presented
here. In the unbinned case, in subsection 5.3 we obtained a rd which is 1.5σ smaller than the
one measured by Planck.
Of course, the results for H0 may vary if one adopts a different binning strategy but we
expect that the significance of the trend do not change significantly. This evolution in the
Hubble constant might offer a new perspective on the Hubble tension. Since we’re using
the w0waCDM model with very broad priors, it seems that a dynamical DE can’t remove
this trend. Using a cosmological constant as the Dark Energy component only reduces the
errorbars of the estimation of H0 due to the reduced parameter space. This may increase the
significance of the non constant models.
Some possible solutions would be either a hidden systematic error or some other assump-
tion in the model. This could even be the reason why SH0ES and Planck have different values
for H0 given that they use data with different redshifts, but this needs further study, maybe
considering H0 not as an integration constant, but as a quantity dependent on the observed
region of the Universe. Unfortunately, directly corroborating that the Hubble parameter at
present time has different values depending on the region of the Universe is difficult, as due
to the finiteness of the speed of light, we observe those regions in the past. However, nothing
prevents us from thinking that just as there are perturbations to matter, these bring with
them anisotropies in the expansion rate of the Universe with H0 being more of an average
value and the local departure of the cosmological principle [65–70].
Our binning strategy splits the data used, reducing the available data in each bin. This,
combined with the decreasing quality in the data, produces large error bars in the inferred
parameters which get worse at large z’s. Therefore the quadratic and Fourier fittings present
large uncertainties. We do not rule out that the constant H0 be the correct result; we need
to wait to improve the quality and number of the data to be able to reach a final conclusion.
The Hubble tension remains one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology
and astrophysics, highlighting persistent discrepancies in H0 values derived from different
– 12 –

observational methods and across varied redshifts. This work contributes to the present dis-
cussion, providing further evidence that the Hubble tension is not only confined to early-
versus late-time measurements but also appears consistently within purely late-time mea-
surements reflecting unresolved aspect of cosmological models and data calibration.
