Abstract
With the rapid advancement of neural language models, the deployment of overparameterized models has surged,
increasing the need for interpretable explanations comprehensible to human inspectors. Existing post-hoc inter-
pretability methods, which often focus on unigram features of single input textual instances, fail to capture the
models’ decision-making process fully. Additionally, many methods do not differentiate between decisions based
on spurious correlations and those based on a holistic understanding of the input. Our paper introduces DISCO,
a novel method for discovering global, rule-based explanations by identifying causal n-gram associations with
model predictions. This method employs a scalable sequence mining technique to extract relevant text spans
from training data, associate them with model predictions, and conduct causality checks to distill robust rules that
elucidate model behavior. These rules expose potential overfitting and provide insights into misleading feature
combinations. We validate DISCO through extensive testing, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in
offering comprehensive insights into complex model behaviors. Our approach successfully identifies all shortcuts
manually introduced into the training data (100% detection rate on the MultiRC dataset), resulting in an 18.8%
regression in model performance—a capability unmatched by any other method. Furthermore, DISCO supports
interactive explanations, enabling human inspectors to distinguish spurious causes in the rule-based output. This
alleviates the burden of abundant instance-wise explanations and helps assess the model’s risk when encountering
out-of-distribution (OOD) data.

1. Introduction
Over-parameterized transformer models for natural language tasks have demonstrated remarkable success.
However, these inherently statistical models are prone to overfitting, particularly in terms of the correlation
between input phrases and prediction labels, known as “shortcuts”, which can lead to biased outcomes
[1, 2]. Our goal is to identify these shortcuts in text classification tasks and enhance human understanding
of the model’s predictive reasoning. We propose a post-hoc, model-agnostic method designed to reduce
the amount of human effort needed to evaluate the justification of the model’s decisions.
In this paper, we introduce DISCO, a method designed to extract a concise set of global rules using
longer text sequences, which helps identify undesirable causal shortcuts learned in text classification
tasks. Figure 1 illustrates the overall structure of DISCO with an example of an extracted rule: First, using
a trained model and its training data, we identify high-support n-gram patterns that strongly correlate
with specific model predictions. Next, we assess whether these identified patterns are true causes of
the predictions or merely associated with them. To do this, we create counterfactuals of the n-gram
patterns and check if the association between the pattern and prediction remains consistent under these

counterfactuals. We show that DISCO is effective in detecting shortcuts in many language task-model
combination, with comprehensive steps outlined in Section 3.
Subsequently, we verify the efficacy of the generated rules by conducting evaluation experiments on
four diverse datasets – Movies, SST-2, MultiRC, and CLIMATE-FEVER, using three underlying pre-trained
models – BERTBASE, SBERT, and LSTM (Section 4). Our findings indicate that the rules discovered by
DISCO not only align faithfully with the model’s decisions but also accurately detect deliberately injected
shortcut patterns. Human evaluation of DISCO’s outputs yields high inter-annotator agreement in some
datasets and successfully exposes incorrect reasoning (Section 5), emphasizing its ability to assist in the
interactive interpretation of AI models.
2. Related Work
In this section, we introduce existing works related to ours, highlight their limitations, and describe how
our approach resolves them.
2.1. Local Interpretability
Considerable work has been done on post-hoc interpretability of language tasks based on token selection
[3, 4, 5, 6]. Interpretable-by-design approaches also often select specific input tokens as rationales for
tasks, using these as intermediate inputs for the prediction model [7, 8, 9]. These approaches focus
on interpreting individual instances, necessitating labor-intensive, human-driven analysis to identify
problematic prediction reasons. Our approach, in contrast, globally extracts rules internalized by the
language model. Other works analyze model behavior using composition operators over primitive
concepts aligned with human-understandable concepts [10]. Despite their global perspective, these
methods do not incorporate causal patterns. Attribution patterns from local interpretability methods lack
inherent causality and may fail to capture the causal relationships internalized by the model. Recent
approaches that aggregate rules from local explanations [11, 12] are also unsuitable for language tasks due
to their reliance on single terms and inability to produce causal rules. SEARs [13] is closer to our work,
detecting semantically equivalent adversarial replacement rules leading to prediction changes. However,
our method identifies patterns consistently leading the model to specific predictions under counterfactual
conditions.
2.2. Causal Inference on Language Tasks
Most research in this area focuses on creating “counterfactual instances”, altered or minimally disturbed
instances, to gain insights into model behavior. These counterfactuals are developed through human

annotation [14] or semi-automatic methods [15, 12]. Models like [16] use a game-theoretic framework
to eliminate words with strong correlations but without causal relationships to the output. Unlike these
studies, our method automatically generates counterfactuals using neutral contexts sampled from the
dataset.
2.3. Rule Extraction for Model Debugging
Recent research characterizes model deficiencies through rules by dataset contamination [17, 2], but
fails to identify human-comprehensible text sequences with high statistical capacity, which is precisely
our aim. Furthermore, our methods are post-hoc and non-intrusive. Anchor [11] identifies local n-gram
phrases with high explanability, but its time complexity results in intractable calculations on the entire
training set. [18] involves a white-box, rule-based method, and [19] identifies spurious correlations rather
than all shortcuts, making them less suitable for direct comparison with our approach. [20] is word-based
and, therefore, not suitable for n-gram rules. These methods adopt a local perspective, aggregating
explanations on an instance-by-instance basis without considering context awareness or causality. Our
approach, in contrast, is n-gram-based, causal, and context-aware, providing a more comprehensive and
insightful analysis.
Atwell et al. [21] aims to evaluate the risk associated with models when exposed to test data with
distribution shifts compared to their original training data. However, their research goal differs from ours.
While their approach yields evaluation scores characterized by bias and h-discrepancy across datasets
from different domains, our approach identifies possible shortcut n-grams learned from the original
training data, offering more intuitive and interpretable shortcut rules.
Traditional research on developing n-gram classifiers focuses on highly interpretable algorithms
leveraging frequent n-grams to discern between different topics [22, 23, 24]. Unfortunately, these
classifiers either do not achieve performance comparable to modern neural models or lack universality.
Our approach bridges the gap between interpretability and performance by effectively identifying high-
support n-gram patterns from underlying neural models.
3. Causal Rule Mining
3.1. Problem Statement
We consider an underlying model 𝑀trained on a classification dataset represented as 𝒟⊂𝒳× 𝒴. Here,
𝒳represents the input space, and 𝒴represents the labels. An input x ∈𝒳is an ordered sequence of
terms (𝑥1, 𝑥2, . . . , 𝑥|x|), where each term 𝑥𝑖comes from the vocabulary 𝒱. The prediction made by
𝑀on input x is denoted as 𝑦^ = argmax𝑦∈𝒴𝑃𝑀(𝑦|x). For simplicity, we abbreviate this as 𝑦^ = 𝑀(x)
throughout this paper. Our research focuses exclusively on binary classification tasks.
We define s = (𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . . , 𝑠𝑛) as an n-gram sub-sequence of x (represented as s ⊑x). The remaining
content in x is denoted as c, i.e., x = ⟨s, c⟩, where ⟨·, ·⟩is the sequence combination operator. Note
that we do not assume sequence continuity in either c or s. The support of s within 𝒟is defined as
Sup(s, 𝒟) = | {x ∈𝒟: s ⊑x} |.
Additionally, we define a rule 𝑟as a tuple (s →𝑦^), where the sequence s is its pattern and 𝑦^ is its
consequent label. For instance, the rule:
the best movie
⏟
 ⏞
 
pattern
→
POS
⏟ ⏞ 
consequent
indicates that “the best movie” is a shortcut for 𝑀to predict POSitive. In this context, we say that 𝑀
predicts 𝑦^ primarily relying on the presence of the sequence s, rather than comprehending the overall
input.
Our objective is to discover a globally representative set of rules, denoted as 𝐺= {𝑟= (s, 𝑦^)}, where
each rule represents a shortcut learned by 𝑀.

3.2. DISCO: Approach Overview
To streamline the identification process, we begin by extracting all high-frequency n-gram patterns from
the training data (Section 3.3). We then retain the candidates that pass the causality check (Section 3.4)
as the final output rules. Our approach is designed to verify the (non-)existence of confounding variables,
serving as a statistical test to establish causality in classification tasks.
3.3. Generation of Candidate Sequences
In the initial step, our primary objective is to extract frequent n-gram sequences that exhibit a high
correlation with specific model predictions.
Sequence Mining. Empirical studies such as [25] emphasize that a pattern is more likely to influence
a model’s prediction as a shortcut if it occurs frequently in the training set. Therefore, we first select all
frequent patterns using an efficient approach known as DESQ-COUNT [26]. For a detailed explanation
of DESQ-COUNT, please refer to [27].
NPMI Evaluation. We further evaluate the pattern-prediction correlation using their NPMI (Normal-
ized Pointwise Mutual Information) score. Initially, we list all input data x from the training set together
with their corresponding predictions from the model 𝑦^ = 𝑀(x). Then we calculate 𝑃(𝑦, s), 𝑃(𝑦|s), and
𝑃(𝑦) from these predictions. It is worth mentioning that these probabilities are different from the model’s
prediction 𝑃𝑀(𝑦^|x). Using these terms, we calculate the NPMI scores for all frequent s identified by
DESQ-COUNT:
NPMI(s; 𝑦) = PMI(𝑦; s)
ℎ(s, 𝑦)
=
log 𝑃(𝑦|s)
𝑃(𝑦)
ℎ(s, 𝑦) ,
where ℎ(s, 𝑦) = −log 𝑃(s, 𝑦) is the entropy of 𝑃(s, 𝑦). The resulting NPMI score falls within the
range of [−1, 1], capturing the spectrum from “never occurring together (-1)” to “independence (0)” and
ultimately “complete co-occurrence (1)” between the pattern and the label. We retain only those pairs
that demonstrate a substantial level of correlation in their NPMI scores.
3.4. Causality Check
Such correlation alone, however, does not guarantee a direct causal relationship, as it could also arise
from a confounding factor [28]. In our context, we assume the confounding factor is the latent semantic
representation z of the input. The presence of sequence pattern s and the context c of the input x are
conditioned on z. An ideal machine learning model should comprehend this structure and capture z, rather
than relying solely on the statistical correlation between s and 𝑦^, also referred to as the “shortcut” [29, 2].
Z
C
S
X
Figure 2: The SCM describing the prediction process of an ideal model. Capital letters represent
corresponding random variables.
We adopt Structured Causal Models (SCMs) [28] to describe the prediction process of the ideal models,
as illustrated in Figure 2. If our underlying model captures the existence of the latent semantic, the

confounding factor z exists and causes the correlation between s and 𝑦^. Otherwise, the model 𝑀simply
relies on the statistical correlation between s and 𝑦^ to make the prediction.
Following [28], we leverage the do-operator on the “back-door” variable s of the input variable x. The
do-operator simulates a physical intervention by replacing a random variable (RV) with a constant value
while keeping the rest of the RVs intact, thereby breaking the potential confounding effect. In our SCM,
applying the do-operator to s means assigning s a specific value and marginalizing over context c.
If the s – 𝑦^ correlation is caused by the confounding factor z, the model’s prediction will differ before
and after the do-operator, because
𝑃(𝑦^|s) =
∑︁
𝑧,c
𝑃(𝑦^|s, c)𝑃(c, s|𝑧)𝑃(𝑧)
̸=
∑︁
𝑧,c
𝑃*(𝑦^|s, c)𝑃*(c|𝑧)𝑃*(𝑧) = 𝑃(𝑦^|do(s = s)),
where 𝑃*(·) denotes the distributions after applying the do-operator.
Note that despite the similarity of our approach with that of [19], their work distinguishes between
“spurious” and “genuine” local shortcuts based on semantic consistency with human understanding. Our
approach emphasizes that all shortcuts learned by DISCO possess a causal attribute globally without
explicitly targeting this distinction due to subjectivity concerns. To highlight the difference between
semantically spurious and causal shortcuts, we measure human agreement on distinguishing “right” from
“wrong” shortcuts introducing human interaction in Section 5.3.
Neutral Context Harvesting One remaining challenge in the algorithm mentioned in the previous
section is sampling the context RV C. This sampling process is often intractable in NLP tasks due to
the varying input lengths and extensive vocabulary size. To address this, we employ a straightforward
technique to reuse contexts c for different s, effectively obtaining contexts for free. Moreover, we reuse
neutral contexts to mitigate the influence of other potential frequent sequences that may exist in the
context. A context is considered neutral when its predicted probabilities lie near the border between two
labels, namely |𝑃𝑀(𝑦= 𝑦0|c) −𝑃𝑀(𝑦= 𝑦1|c)| = |2𝑃𝑀(𝑦= 𝑦0|c) −1| < 𝜖𝑛, where 0 < 𝜖𝑛< 1 is
the neutrality tolerance.
It is noteworthy that complex modern numerical sampling techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) [30], require careful handling to preserve contextual fluency and ensure the neutrality of
the sentiment. Therefore, perfecting the generation of bias-free and neutral counterfactual contexts falls
outside the scope of this paper. The exploration of alternative sampling techniques is left for future work.
3.5. A Toy Example
At the end of this section, we provide a toy example to assist our readers in understanding the full process
of our approach. We consider an extreme situation as follows to help illustrate. Assume a sentiment
analysis problem where all reviews on books are positive, and all reviews on movies are negative in the
training data. A model trained on such data might incorrectly predict positive for a review like “this book
is badly written” due to its overfitting to the correlation between the sequence “this book” and the label
positive. It is worth mentioning that such sequences may appear semantically senseless and therefore
“non-causal” to humans. The resulting rules reflect the rational basis of the model’s prediction, rather than
convincing a human inspector of its causality.
In DISCO, we apply DESQ first to identify the correlation between the sequence “this book” and the
label positive from the training data. This pair is then subjected to an NPMI check to decide whether it
is a candidate sequence (Section 3.3). Then, in the causality check (Section 3.4), we keep “this book”
constant and vary its contexts to other neutral contexts (Section 3.4) like “was played in the cinema” or
“is on the table”. If the prediction predominantly remains positive, we infer that “this book” – positive is
a shortcut.

4. Experimental Evaluation
4.1. Research Questions
Our experiments aim to answer the following research questions (RQs):
• RQ1. Faithfulness: Are the global rules faithful to the model’s local explanations?
• RQ2. Recall: If the model is known to have learned some shortcuts, can DISCO identify them?
• RQ3. Human Utility: Are the shortcut rules useful for humans in detecting the model’s wrong
reasons?
4.2. Models and Datasets
Our approach is model-agnostic. Therefore, we conduct experiments on multiple models to answer RQ1
and RQ3, including an LSTM model and two over-parameterized transformer models, BERTBASE and
SBERT [31].
The experiments are conducted on one document classification and three multi-task datasets. Given the
foundational role of document classification in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing
(NLP), we employ a unified approach, transforming all datasets into binary classification: Movies from
the ERASER benchmark [32] is originally a binary sentiment classification dataset. MultiRC from the
same benchmark is converted following the recipe presented in [32]. For SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment
Treebank) [33], we binarize the sentiment assigned to each input sentence. As for CLIMATE-FEVER, a
fact-checking dataset from ir_datasets [34] with queries and documents regarding climate change,
we combine each query with each of its relevant/irrelevant documents as the inputs, while assigning
“relevant”/“irrelevant” as their labels.
4.3. The Agreement Score as a Metric of Faithfulness
Local interpretation approaches, such as LIME [6] and ExPred [9], provide relatively faithful instance-wise
explanations. Although researchers are questioning the quality of LIME explanations [35], LIMEbalances
time efficiency and faithfulness well, to the best of our knowledge. Our global rules are considered
faithful to the local explanations if they agree with the local explanations in all applicable instances. We
define an input x as applicable to a rule 𝑟= (s →𝑦^) if s ⊑x. Additionally, an applicable input x
further satisfies the rule 𝑟if its prediction matches the rule’s consequent, i.e., 𝑦^ = 𝑀(x).
For an input-prediction pair (x, 𝑦^), an instance-wise explainer attributes the prediction 𝑃𝑀(𝑦^|x) to 𝑥𝑖
as attribution score 𝑎𝑦^
𝑖∈R. The gathering of all attribution scores of x is represented using a𝑦^. For clarity,
we ignore the superscripts of 𝑦^ in the rest of this section. We rank all terms based on their attribution
scores in descending order, denoted as ℛa(x) = (𝑥𝑘1, 𝑥𝑘2, . . . , 𝑥𝑘𝑛), where 𝑎𝑘1 ≥𝑎𝑘2 ≥. . . ≥𝑎𝑘𝑛are
re-ranked token indices.
For an input x that satisfies a rule 𝑟, we define the agreement score between 𝑟and ℛa(x) as:
agreement(𝑟, ℛa(x)) = ranking score(ℛa(x); s),
where the semicolon in the ranking score calculation separates the ranking sequence ℛa(x) from the
subsequence s.
We borrow the nDCG score [36] from ranking evaluation tasks as the ranking score function here and
consider the pattern terms as the “ground truth” terms. The intuition behind this metric is that the terms
selected by the rule (ground truth) should be assigned the highest attribution scores and thus ranked
the highest. A higher agreement score indicates that the rule is more faithful to a local explanation.
For example, given x = “a b c” with corresponding attribution scores a = [0.1, 0.5, 0.4]. The tokens
are therefore ranked as “b – c – a”. If s = “a b”, the agreement score is therefore nDCG@k((“a b” →
𝑦^), b – c – a) =
0.5/ log2(1+1)
0.5/ log2(1+1)+0.1/ log2(2+1) = 0.89 for 𝑘= 2.

4.4. Experiment Environment
Our approach is implemented in Python 3.7.3, utilizing PyTorch version 1.12.1+cu133. All experiments
are conducted on a Linux server equipped with an AMD®EPYC®7513 processor and an Nvidia®A100
GPU with 40 GB of display memory.
5. Results
5.1. RQ1. Faithfulness
We address this research question through two experiments: explanation alignment and an ablation study.
In this section, we mine rules from BERTBASE [37] models fine-tuned on different datasets.
5.1.1. Agreement with Local Explanations
We aim to evaluate whether the global rules are consistent with the local explanations by measuring the
agreement scores between them. Overall, we find a high degree of alignment between the global rules
and the local explanations across all three datasets, with low variance (Fig. 3). It is worth mentioning that
the lowest agreement score appears on Movies with ExPred, being 0.695, which is the only outlier. The
remaining scores range from 0.81 to 0.923. For exact results, we refer to Table 2. This indicates that our
rules faithfully represent the model’s explanations.

Figure 3: Rules’ agreement scores with LIME and ExPred. For MultiRC, we only consider patterns mined
from its documents, excluding those from its queries.
Moreover, we observed a slight exception in the SST-2 dataset, where the low frequency of sequences
leads to a small number of dominant rules and relatively higher variance. Nevertheless, upon manual
examination of the rules, we found that most high-coverage rules in this dataset are correct and result in
the right prediction. For a detailed evaluation, please refer to Section 5.3.
It should be noted that the CLIMATE-FEVER dataset is not included in this analysis because it provides
no rationale annotations, making it impossible to train the ExPred model on it. Based on our results, we
can conclude that for Movies, SST-2, and MultiRC, the rules with the highest satisfaction are usually the
correct reasons for the model’s predictions, as they tend to have high alignment with local explanations.
However, some rules, such as don’t even →NEG for Movies and in its →POS for SST-2, suggest that
the model has also learned some incorrect shortcuts. Relying on incorrect shortcuts could be even more
detrimental to the model’s performance when deployed in the field and encountering out-of-distribution

(OOD) data. This is supported by the model’s behavior on the counterfactuals generated during the
causality check. We list some counterfactual examples in Table 1.

5.1.2. Ablation Study
To the best of our knowledge, our work is pioneering in the extraction of global causal rules learned by
the model, making it challenging to establish appropriate baseline methods. Instead, we conduct ablation
studies on different components of our approach, DISCO, to assess its ability to discover causal rules, as
summarized in Table 2. We select the top-15 (s, 𝑦^) pairs based on their coverage under three conditions:
1) NPMI score filtering only, 2) DISCO with both NPMI and causality checks, and 3) the intersection (∩)
between 1) and 2). We measure the average agreement scores among these configurations.

Table 2

The results presented in Table 2 demonstrate that DISCO with all its processes (2)) achieves higher
agreement scores than the NPMI filter alone across all datasets, compared to ExPred. However, for
LIME, the intersection (3)) appears to outperform the other configurations. This observation suggests that
the causality check following the NPMI filter can, to some extent, filter out correlated yet non-causal
(s, 𝑦^) pairs, resulting in a greater number of causal rules that accurately reflect the model’s predictions.
Although our approach shows high agreement scores with local attributions, we must emphasize that the
causality of the rules before the causality check cannot be guaranteed.
We would like to re-emphasize that we cannot use [16] as our baseline model, because it produces
only unigram-based rules and is therefore incomparable with our approach. Modern language models are
designed to internalize contextual information between input tokens [37, 31]. Our approach identifies
shortcut rules for such contextual information. For example, from “(This book is badly written, POS)”,
our approach can recognize the shortcut rule “(This book −→POS)”, while a unigram approach fails.
Another critical reason is the intractability of generating multi-word rules using their approach regarding
time complexity: mining a rule with four adjacent tokens bloats the search space to |𝑉|4. Likewise, [19]
is also unsuitable as our baseline model. Additionally, [19] focuses on a different goal of distinguishing
between “spurious” and “genuine” shortcuts based on their consistency with human understanding, while
our work does not seek to differentiate these two groups. We, in contrast, leave the task of deciding “right”
or “wrong” reasons using subjective human interaction as presented in Section 5.3.
5.1.3. Hyperparameters
For the Movies dataset, we mine sequences with lengths ranging from 4 to 10, and a support value of 20.
During the causality check, we consider rules where the average prediction over all synthetic instances is
greater than 0.7, serving as the mean threshold.
For SST-2, the sequence lengths range from 2 to 10, the support value is 100, and the mean threshold
is 0.7.
Both datasets are sentiment analysis datasets containing no queries1.
On the other hand, MultiRC and CLIMATE-FEVER datasets consist of instances that include a query and
a document. The pattern of their rules is (s𝑞, s𝑑) tuples, indicating a combination of a sequence s𝑞from
the query and a sequence s𝑑from the document. During sequence mining, s𝑞and s𝑑are jointly extracted
from the query and document for each instance.
For MultiRC, the lengths of s𝑞and s𝑑are constrained within the ranges of 3 to 10 and 4 to 10,
respectively. The support value for tuples is set to 200, and the mean threshold is 0.7. For CLIMATE-FEVER,
the sequence lengths of s𝑞and s𝑑are within the ranges of 2 to 10. The tuple support is set to 200, and the
mean threshold remains at 0.7.
5.1.4. Statistics
The statistics of the rules are summarized in Table 3, showcasing key metrics such as #(frequent),

5.2. RQ2. Recall
This research question serves two purposes: 1) to validate our assumption that highly correlated patterns
and labels lead to the model learning shortcuts, and 2) to demonstrate the capability of DISCO in
identifying these shortcuts.
Quantitatively evaluating the retention rate of shortcuts by DISCO poses a challenge as it requires
knowledge of the ground-truth correlated pattern-label pairs. This challenge is common in the evaluation
of explanations [38, 39]. To overcome this issue, we deliberately introduce decoys [1] into the dataset
to entice the model into learning shortcuts. All decoys are presented in Table 4. Following a similar
methodology to that of [25], we contaminate the original training set with decoy patterns, varying the
contamination rate and bias. It is important to note that we only contaminate the training and validation
sets, keeping the test set intact. This setup simulates a scenario where the model performs well on a
biased dataset but lacks generalization due to learned shortcuts. If our approach can successfully identify
the injected decoys, we consider it a success.
5.2.1. Contamination Rate, Bias, and Retention Rate
The extent of contamination is described by the contamination rate and the bias.
We define contamination rate as the ratio of instances containing the decoy, namely |X𝑑|
|X| . We further
define bias as the label imbalance when adding the decoy, namely max𝑦∈𝒴
∑︀
𝑦𝑖∈Y𝑑1(𝑦𝑖= 𝑦), where
Y𝑑indicates the labels corresponding to all contaminated instances. The label 𝑦selected by the max𝑦∈Y
operator is referred to as the dominant label.
The retention rate is the fraction of decoys that can be detected. A decoy is considered detected if the
output of our approach contains the rule constructed by the decoy and its corresponding label. To the
best of our knowledge, our study is also the first to systematically investigate the retention rate of decoys
under different contamination rates and biases.
5.2.2. Contamination-Bias Settings
To evaluate the retention rate of DISCO across various scenarios, we examine four different settings that
produce different contamination rates and biases: {80%, 20%} × {60%, 90%}. Figure 4 illustrates the
retention rate and task performance for each of these settings.
5.2.3. Observations
Figure 4 (third row) demonstrates that adding decoys to the training set has minimal effect on test
performance, indicating that the introduced decoys do not significantly alter the data distribution. We

also measured the faithfulness of DISCO to show that the decoys are indeed learned as shortcuts by the
model. The heatmap in Figure 4 illustrates that under high-bias, high-contamination settings, DISCO can
successfully identify our injected decoys, except for SST-2. We also observed that high-bias settings are
easier to detect compared to high-contamination settings.
5.3. RQ3. Human Utility
A shortcut rule can be a good reason for a model decision, but can also be a wrong one. To measure
the human perception of model-generated rules, and to see whether the rules help humans detect wrong
reasons for a decision, we conducted experiments using the uncontaminated four training sets with three
different models: BERTBASE, LSTM, and SBERT. The extracted rules were independently shown to four
machine learning developers who were asked to assess whether a rule was a “wrong reason”. A wrong
reason is an explanation that is either non-understandable or implausible, given the underlying language
task. For example, the pattern “? | |” of a rule is non-understandable as it contains no meaningful words,
while the rule “in its −→POS” is implausible for a sentiment classification task.
5.3.1. Results
To report the inter-annotator agreement, we utilized Fleiss’ kappa, a metric assessing the reliability of
agreement between raters2 (see Figure 5). We observed a high inter-annotator agreement of ≥0.54 for
BERTBASE and SBERT on the CLIMATE-FEVER dataset, and complete agreement for the MultiRC dataset.
Interestingly, for the SST-2 dataset, we observed a low inter-rater agreement of −0.041 for the LSTM
model. This was primarily due to the extraction of rules with extremely short sequences, such as “n ’ t
−→NEG” by DISCO. Low Fleiss’ 𝜅among human evaluators on particular datasets and models indicates

consistency with human understanding. However, high Fleiss’ 𝜅in certain datasets indicates that DISCO
indeed aids humans in identifying easily distinguishable incorrect justifications for a model’s decision.
It is notable that even in BERTBASE and SBERT models, which are known for their robustness due to
pre-training and knowledgeable priors, “wrong” rules exist. For instance, even BERTBASE learns spurious
rules like “this film −→NEG” from the Movies dataset. Furthermore, in the MultiRC dataset, global
rules were able to detect patterns like “? | |”, resulting in a perfect Fleiss’ kappa.
Selected examples in Table 1 highlight the model’s tendency to predict by relying on specific text
patterns, overlooking the broader context. For instance, shortcuts such as “of the world trade center” are
not relevant to the classification task, yet the model uses them. This reliance on shortcuts can compromise
the model’s ability to generalize and make accurate predictions in varied contexts.
6. Conclusion
This paper introduces DISCO, a method designed to identify causal rules internalized by neural models in
natural language tasks. DISCO produces a concise and statistically robust set of causal rules, enabling
users to scrutinize and understand the underlying knowledge captured by the model. The intrinsic causal
orientation of our approach ensures that the resultant rules are faithful to the inputs where they are
applicable. We demonstrate the efficacy of DISCO by identifying shortcuts learned by prominent models,
including BERTBASE, SBERT, and LSTM. Our approach not only reveals these shortcuts but also provides
insights into the model’s decision-making process. In essence, DISCO stands as an instrumental resource
for those aiming to gain deeper insights into the interactive explainability of AI models.

7. Limitations
One limitation of our approach arises from the context selection when constructing the counterfactual.
Reusing neutral contexts is a straightforward method to generate human-understandable replacements for
counterfactual contexts. However, this strategy possesses three inherent limitations:
First, the availability of context is constrained. We only employ contexts present in the training data,
limiting the sampling space and potentially compromising the effectiveness of the do-operator. Further-
more, selecting neutral contexts further narrows the sampling space and may introduce discrepancies
between the sampled contexts and the training contexts, affecting the data distribution.
Additionally, compared to related works like [19], we do not differentiate between “spurious” and
“genuine” reasons for predictions. However, this distinction is of lesser concern as our objective is to
identify globally overfit shortcut patterns within the model, rather than pinpointing specific reasons for
individual predictions, nor do we care about their faithfulness.
A third limitation concerns the experiments conducted. Although the theory and approach of our
work do not require sequence continuity, all experiments are based on consecutive sequences. Exploring
efficient methods to identify sequences with gaps or even more complex patterns remains a potential
avenue for future research.
