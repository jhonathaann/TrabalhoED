Abstract
Nascent binaries (NBs) are binary systems with very low mass ratios, less than ∼0.2, in which
the more massive component is an O- or B-type main-sequence star, while the secondary is a
star contracting onto the main sequence. NBs are of interest because they can help to under-
stand the formation of small-mass ratio systems and shed light on the origin of low-mass X-ray
binaries, millisecond pulsars and type Ia supernovae. In photometry, short-period NBs show
a strong irradiation effect due to the large difference between the effective temperatures of the
components and the strong irradiation of a cool secondary by a hot primary. In spectroscopy,
they usually appear as single-lined spectroscopic binaries. In the present paper, we summarize
the status of our knowledge of Galactic nascent binaries and characterize two new members
of this group, c2 Sco and V390 Pup, for which photometric data were obtained by the BRIght
Target Explorer (BRITE) nano-satellite mission.
Keywords: stars: binary, stars: variability, stars: pulsations, stars: pre-main sequence

Introduction
As a result of their search for small-mass ratio systems among massive eclipsing stars
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), Moe and Di Stefano (2015) found a group of 22 stars
characterized by narrow eclipse widths and low eclipse depths ratios. Such systems were also
characterized by a strong irradiation (reﬂection) effect and their orbital periods ranged between
3 and 8.5 days. An estimation of the parameters of the components of such systems led these
authors to the conclusion that they consist of a massive binary of O or early B spectral type
and a cool pre-main sequence (PMS) secondary, strongly irradiated by the hot companion.
Because of their young age, the systems were dubbed nascent binaries (NBs). In fact, NBs
are strongly related to so-called Lindroos systems (Lindroos, 1986, and earlier papers of the
series), Galactic visual binary systems comprised of an early-type main-sequence (MS) star
and a late-type secondary. Lindroos (1986) found that in 37 systems the ages of secondaries
are shorter than the time of contraction onto the zero-age MS (ZAMS) and described them as
post-T Tauri stars contracting onto the MS. These stars can be therefore regarded as NBs in
systems with wide orbits.

If we adopt that nascent binaries are systems consisting of a massive MS star and a low-
mass pre-MS star, we can conclude that such systems can be discovered by several complemen-
tary methods. Close systems of this type can be discovered following Moe and Di Stefano
(2015), that is, by searching for eclipsing binaries with a hot primary component, narrow
eclipses and a strong irradiation effect. In general, however, such systems need not be eclipsing,
as we will comment in Sect. 2. Spectroscopically, NBs, both eclipsing and non-eclipsing, will
be mostly single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1). Thus, it seems that a natural method to
search for NBs, both eclipsing and non-eclipsing, is to analyse the photometry of SB1 systems,
a method we applied in Sect. 3 to observations from BRITE satellites. Finally, such systems can
be found among relatively nearby visual systems for which the secondary components can be
characterized observationally, i.e. in the way Lindroos (1986) did. One of the key observations
that can in such systems indicate the PMS status of the secondary component is a detection
of an X-ray emission of the secondary, like in the β Cru system (Cohen et al., 2008), a triple
system containing a PMS star.

Galactic nascent binaries
Given the relatively small number of nearby B-type MS stars Moe and Di Stefano (2015)
concluded that “It is therefore not surprising that we have not yet observed in the Milky Way the
precise counterparts to our reﬂecting eclipsing binaries with B-type MS primaries and low-mass
pre-MS companions.” Galactic NBs are known, however, including Lindroos stars mentioned
above. One of the ﬁrst discovered Galactic NB systems was 16 (EN) Lac, an SB1 system
composed of the B2 IV primary component, which pulsates as a β Cephei-type star and a low-
mass component. It is an eclipsing binary with the orbital period of 12.097 d. Modelling of the
primary eclipse and other considerations led Pigulski and Jerzykiewicz (1988) to conclude that
the secondary is a likely PMS star, which was later conﬁrmed by Jerzykiewicz et al. (2015). The
system is too wide to show signiﬁcant irradiation effect, however. A very shallow secondary
eclipse was found recently in this system with the precise Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
(TESS) data (Southworth and Bowman, 2022). The next Galactic NB is the bright eclipsing
binary λ Sco, in which the primary pulsates as a β Cep-type star. The secondary component of
this triple star was found to be a PMS star by Uytterhoeven et al. (2004) and Tango et al. (2006).
The increasing precision of space-based data allowed the discovery of further Galactic
NBs. Another eclipsing NB was µ Eri, consisting of a B5 IV primary pulsating in g-modes
(an SPB-type variability) and a low-mass secondary (Jerzykiewicz et al., 2013). Using the Mi-
crovariability and Oscillations of STars (MOST) satellite data, these authors concluded that the
secondary can be a PMS star. Two bright non-eclipsing NBs, ν Centauri and γ Lupi, were dis-
covered using space-based BRIght Target Explorer (BRITE) data (Jerzykiewicz et al., 2021).
In both stars, two-colour BRITE data revealed photometric variability with the same period as
the variability of their radial velocities. This variability was attributed to the irradiation effect
as the period of variability was consistent with the orbital period and the red-ﬁlter amplitude
was higher than the blue-ﬁlter amplitude, as expected for such systems. This showed that non-
eclipsing NBs can be discovered provided that radial-velocity data are available. This type of
2

variability is designated ‘R’ in the Variability Star Index (VSX, Watson et al., 2006).
The TESS data have proven to be an excellent source of precision photometry for discov-
ering Galactic NBs, in particular those similar to Moe and Di Stefano (2015) stars, i.e. with
strong irradiation effect. Such stars have been found by Stassun et al. (2021) and more recently
by Nazé et al. (2023). It is also easy to identify such candidates among the stars presented
by Eze and Handler (2024), although in each of these cases modelling and, in particular, an
estimate of the age of these systems is needed to be able to verify whether the secondary com-
ponents are indeed PMS stars. Radial velocities are also a crucial element: indeed, only the
combined analysis of photometry and velocities can conﬁrm that the O- or B-type star is the
hottest component of the system and exclude post-interaction cases with a hot stripped star
paired to the O- or B-type star.

New nascent binaries with BRITE observations
In this study, we have chosen to use BRITE Constellation data (Weiss et al., 2014; Pablo et al.,
2016; Popowicz et al., 2017) as the main data source. Currently, such data are available for 716
bright stars (Zwintz et al., 2024). Bright stars tend to have observations of many kinds, in-
cluding spectroscopic ones, which allows us to more easily determine the parameters of the
components and, in particular, to verify whether the secondary components are PMS stars. Us-
ing the 9th Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits (Pourbaix et al., 2004) we checked which
of the stars observed by BRITEs are known to be SB1 systems. The search resulted in the
selection of 39 SB1 systems with primaries of spectral type B5 or earlier. Of these stars, 16
had orbital periods shorter than 15 d, giving a chance of detecting an irradiation effect. The
sample included ﬁve known Galactic NBs mentioned in Sect. 2, 16 (EN) Lac, µ Eri, ν Cen,
γ Lup A and λ Sco. We carefully checked the BRITE and TESS photometry of the remaining
11 stars and found two candidates for Galactic nascent binaries. These are c2 Sco (Sect. 3.1)
and V390 Pup (Sect. 3.2).
3.1.
HD 145482 (13 c2 Sco)
HD 145482 (13 c2 Sco, V = 4.6 mag, B2.5 Vn) was found spectroscopically variable by
Campbell and Moore (1928), which was later conﬁrmed by Buscombe and Morris (1960), van Hoof et al.
(1963) and van Albada and Sher (1969). The ﬁrst spectroscopic orbit was derived by Levato et al.
(1987), who concluded that radial velocities of this star vary with a period of 5.780531(58) d.
HD 145482 was one of the targets of BRITE-Heweliusz red-ﬁlter BRITE satellite in Field
Sco I. The observations spanned 63 days in 2015. The data show clearly the variability with
a period of about 5.77 d (Zwintz et al., 2024), similar to the spectroscopic period. The star
was also observed by three other space missions: The Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI,
Eyles et al., 2003) with observations spanning almost 8 years between 2003 and 2010, Kepler
K2 mission with observations taken during Campaign 2 in 2014 and spanning 75 days, and
TESS mission, which observed the star in Sector 12. The TESS observations spanned 24 days
in 2019. First, we have analyzed the data sets separately. All they reveal clear variability with
3

the same period of about 5.77 d. We then normalized all four data sets by their amplitudes and
combined. The ﬁnal ﬁt to the combined SMEI, K2, BRITE and TESS photometric data, which
included also the ﬁrst harmonic of the main frequency, resulted in the period of 5.77101(30) d.
This is in perfect agreement with the period of 5.77102 d derived by Sebastian A. Otero and
reported in the VSX web page and slightly off the period of 5.814(5) d found by Balona (2016)
from the K2 data (the star is EPIC 202909059) and 5.804 d derived by Shultz et al. (2022). The
photometric data, phased with the derived period, are shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1: BRITE (red dots), Kepler K2 (orange dots) and TESS (violet
dots) and SMEI (green dots) data of HD 145482 freed from the strongest
pulsation terms and phased with the period of 5.77101 d. Phase 0.0
corresponds to HJD 2456458.26, the time of the maximum light of the
main term in the combined photometric data.
The semi-amplitudes of the variability of the main term are equal to 4.38(5), 4.64(11),
5.54(15) and 7.463(7) mmag for the K2, BRITE, SMEI and TESS observations, respectively.
This sequence of increasing amplitudes corresponds to the increasing median wavelengths of
the corresponding passbands. The amplitude is the largest for the TESS data, as the TESS pass-
band has the longest median wavelength of about 800 nm. This behaviour (larger amplitudes at
longer wavelengths) is the same as for ν Cen and γ Lup A (Jerzykiewicz et al., 2021), which is
a good argument in favour of the explanation of the variability seen in Fig. 1 by the irradiation
effect.
In addition to this nearly sinusoidal variability with the period of about 5.77 d, the residual
frequency spectra show additional variability, mainly in the low-frequency region (Fig. 2). In
particular, the strongest term that can be seen in all three data sets shown in Fig. 2 (the SMEI
data are too scattered to reveal this variability) has the frequency of 1.8855(6) in the Kepler data
and 1.8845(2) in the TESS data. A peak at this frequency can be also seen in the BRITE data,
although the BRITE data are more scattered than the TESS and K2 data. These frequencies
correspond to the period of about 0.5305 d, which is in agreement with the period of 0.53042 d
reported in VSX. It can be seen from Fig. 2, however, that there are more frequencies that can
be extracted from these data. Given the values of these frequencies and the spectral type of

the primary, it is very likely that these frequencies represent g-modes excited in the primary.
It is also possible that some high-frequency peaks, seen around 6 and 8 d−1 in the TESS data
in Fig. 2 represent p-modes. It is therefore quite likely that the primary in this system is an
SPB-type variable, maybe even a hybrid SPB/β Cep-type variable.
The spectroscopic data of HD 145482 are scattered and most of them was obtained more
than 45 years ago. They consist of three spectra made in 1915 and 1916 at Lick Observatory,
USA (Campbell and Moore, 1928), seven spectra made in 1955 at McDonald Observatory, USA
(van Hoof et al., 1963), three spectra made in 1956 and 1957 at Mount Stromlo Observatory,
Australia (Buscombe and Morris, 1960), 13 spectra obtained by van Albada and Sher (1969) in
1966 at Radcliffe Observatory, South Africa, and eight spectra taken in the years 1974 – 1977
at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO), Chile, and Kitt Peak National Observatory,
USA (Levato et al., 1987) and a single spectrum obtained with UVES at VLT in Paranal Ob-
servatory, Chile (Borisov et al., 2023). Three spectra were also obtained with the CHIRON
spectrograph at CTIO (Gullikson et al., 2016b), but radial velocities of the primary were not
given. We transformed all times of observations to Heliocentric Julian Day (HJD) and phased
the reported radial velocities with the same period and initial epoch as the photometric data
shown in Fig. 1. The resulting radial-velocity curve is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen from
this ﬁgure that, despite that some radial-velocity data are discrepant, the maximum of the radial
velocity curve is around phase 0.25. Since phase 0.0 corresponds to the light maximum (Fig. 1),
this is exactly the relationship between the phases of the light variability and the variation in
radial velocities that can be expected when the source of photometric variation is the irradiation
effect.

with the orbital period of 5.77101 d. Phase 0.0 corresponds to the same
time as in Fig. 1.
An additional conﬁrmation of c2 Sco as a new NB comes from the location of the secondary
in the mass – age diagram, shown in Fig. 8. The parameters, secondary’s mass of 1.1+0.07
−0.08 M⊙
and age of 8+6
−3 Myr, were taken from Gullikson et al. (2016a). It is clear from this plot that
the secondary is a PMS star. Therefore, we conclude that, in addition to ν Cen and γ Lup A,
c2 Sco is the third known non-eclipsing Galactic nascent binary with its photometric variability
dominated the the irradiation effect.

HD 62747 (V390 Pup)
HD 62747 (V = 5.6 mag, B1.5 III) was ﬁrst searched for variability by Jerzykiewicz and Sterken
(1977), but the result was inconclusive due to the variability of one of the comparison stars. It
was found an eclipsing variable from the Hipparcos data with a period of 3.9279 d (ESA, 1997).
The star was observed with red-ﬁlter BRITE-Toronto satellite in the Field CMa I. The obser-
vations spanned 105 days between December 10, 2015 and March 24, 2016. The BRITE data
conﬁrmed the eclipsing nature of the variability (Zwintz et al., 2024). Figure 4 shows the Hip-
parcos and BRITE data phased with the orbital period of 3.9276888 d, derived below. The
BRITE data revealed shallow secondary eclipse which was not covered by the Hipparcos data.
The most abundant precise photometric observations of V390 Pup were, however, obtained
by the TESS satellite, which observed this star in three sectors, Sector 7 (late 2018 – early
2019), 34 (in 2021) and 61 (in 2023). The orbital period of the star was derived by several
investigators: 3.89(3) d (Burssens et al., 2020), 3.92720311 d (Justesen and Albrecht, 2021),
3.92609 d (IJspeert et al., 2021), 3.9279 d (Shi et al., 2022) and 3.92733(35) (Prša et al., 2022).
We carried out our own analysis of the TESS photometry of V390 Pup and derived the
orbital period of 3.9276888(6) d, which is based on the observations from all three sectors men-
tioned above, spanning slightly more than four years. We also modelled the light curve using
the JKTEBOP modelling code (Southworth, 2012). The most important parameters derived
from this modelling were the following (we assumed that the orbit is circular): inclination of

son of the TESS light curve with the ﬁtted model is shown in Fig. 5. It is clear that in addition
to the signiﬁcant irradiation effect, the ellipsoidal effect also contributes to the out-of-eclipse
variability, which makes the light curve relatively ﬂat in the vicinity of the secondary eclipse.

Burssens et al. (2020) already noted that some low-frequency variability is present out of
eclipse in the light curve of V390 Pup. We therefore subtracted the orbital frequency and its
harmonics and calculated Fourier frequency spectrum, which is shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen
in this ﬁgure that the star shows variability which, given the spectral type of the primary, can be
attributed to both g-modes (lower frequencies) and p-modes (higher frequencies). In addition,
there is a clear increase of power towards the lowest frequencies, an indication of stochastic

variability observed in many early B-type stars (e.g. Bowman et al., 2019).

Spectroscopy of V390 Pup is scarce and was obtained mainly to derive its spectral type, ro-
tational velocity or other atmospheric parameters (Hiltner et al., 1969; Lyubimkov et al., 2004;
Telting et al., 2006; Simón-Díaz and Herrero, 2014). There is, however, no time-series spec-
troscopy of this star aimed at detection of the variability of its radial velocities. Neverthe-
less, the star is an SB1 system since no information on the detection of secondary’s lines
was announced. In cooperation with Dr. L.Vanzi and P. Torres from Pontiﬁcia Universidad
Católica (PUC) de Chile, a series of spectroscopic observations of the system was obtained us-
ing FIDEOS spectrograph (Vanzi et al., 2018). Full analysis of the combined spectroscopy and
photometry of V390 Pup will be published elsewhere. Here, we use only the preliminary value
of the half-range of the radial-velocity variations derived from these observations and equal to
K1 = 34.7 ± 1.9 km s−1, which is needed to get a rough estimate of the secondary’s mass. This
value of K1 results in the mass function equal to f(M) = 0.0170(28)M⊙. In the low-mass ratio
eclipsing systems, secondary’s mass and radius can be derived quite precisely because of the
weak dependence of these parameters on the (assumed) primary’s mass. An example of this
kind of estimation is shown in Fig. 7.
Figure 7 shows the secondary’s mass in the V390 Pup system, M2, and the radii of both
components, R1 and R2, as a function of the primary’s mass. Assuming primary’s mass speciﬁc
for its spectral type and luminosity class, M1 = 9 ± 2 M⊙, and using relations shown in Fig. 7,
we get M2 = 1.27+0.17
−0.19 M⊙, R2 = 1.85+0.12
−0.14 R⊙, and R1 = 7.55+0.50
−0.58 R⊙. An estimated age of
the primary, 16.2 ±1.0 Myr (Grosbøl, 1978), places the secondary in the area of PMS stars, as
shown in Fig. 8. The secondary’s radius is signiﬁcantly larger than expected for the zero-age
main sequence star with secondary’s mass, which can also be an indication of its PMS nature.

observed with BRITE satellites. Table 1 provides for all these stars orbital periods, spectral
types of primaries, (SpT)1, the masses of secondaries, M2, mass ratios, q = M2/M1 and ages.
All known Galactic NBs are also shown in the mass – age diagram (Fig. 8). In addition to the
NBs we also show an example of a star, which, similarly to the short-period NBs, shows a
9

signiﬁcant irradiation effect. This is HD 165246 (Johnston et al., 2021). With the secondary’s
mass M2 = 3.8+0.4
−0.5 M⊙and age estimation between 2 and 4.5 Myr, derived by these authors,
the star locates close to the zero-age main sequence and therefore cannot be regarded as a
nascent binary. This shows that, although the irradiation effect can be used to ﬁnd candidates
for NBs, the ﬁnal veriﬁcation of the evolutionary status of the secondary component should
involve modelling of the light curve and measurements of radial velocities.

Following on from the Introduction, it seems that the most effective method of searching
for new Galactic NBs is to survey the light curves of eclipsing binaries with a massive primary
component, that is, with an O or early B-type primary. Systems with strong irradiation effect
will be good candidates for NBs. In this context, it seems that TESS observations should be a
particularly good source of data. With reference to Fig. 8, in order to verify the evolutionary
status of the secondary components, it is also important to determine the age of the system. For
such determinations, comparison of the primary component’s parameters with models is most
commonly used. An alternative is the determination of the age of the parent open cluster or the
OB association, provided that the system is a member.
