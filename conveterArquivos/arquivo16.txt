The number of type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) observations will grow significantly within the
next decade, mainly thanks to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) undertaken
by the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile. With this improvement, statistical uncertainties
will decrease, and flux calibration will become the main uncertainty for the characterization
of dark energy. Currently, the astronomical flux scale is anchored on the numerical models
of white dwarf atmospheres from the CALSPEC catalog, and every error on the model can
induce a bias over cosmological parameters inference. The StarDICE experiment proposes a
new calibration reference that only relies on observations from the optical watt defined by the
NIST towards the magnitude of standard stars. It is currently operating at l’Observatoire
de Haute-Provence and has been collecting data since the beginning of 2023. To overcome
the photometric calibration uncertainty and reach a sub-percent precision, the instrument
throughput has been calibrated with a Collimated Beam Projector.
It will be monitored
on-site with a LED-based artificial star source calibrated with NIST photodiodes. In this
proceeding, we will first illustrate how an error in the photometric calibration can impact the
SNe Ia distance moduli and thus bias the measurement of cosmological parameters. Then we
will present the StarDICE experiment and how we can recalibrate the CALSPEC catalog at
the millimagnitude level on the NIST scale with photometric analysis.

CALSPEC calibration
Nowadays, the CALSPEC calibration is the state-of-the-art for the astrophysical photometric
calibration.
The three CALSPEC prime standards are pure hydrogen white dwarfs (WD),
named G191B2B, GD71 and GD153. The calibration of their spectral density energy (SED)
is anchored on numerical model of their atmosphere. In few words, the numerical radiative

transfer model of their atmosphere is fitted on the hydrogen absorption lines obtained with high-
resolution spectroscopy from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) of the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) (see Bohlin et al., 20141 for the detailed method). Over the past
decade, the CALSPEC calibration has undergone multiple releases, coming from the evolution
of the model used to simulate the WD atmosphere. Hence, the calibrated spectra of the three
primary standards vary with the CALSPEC release used. Figure 1 illustrates the relative flux
in the G191B2B SED, revealing a chromatic variation of up to ∼2% between the different
CALSPEC releases.

Simulation of SNe Ia observation and calibration
We aim to track variations in the calibration and their impact on dark energy parameter con-
straints using simulations from the Lemaˆıtre project presented by Lacroix, this proceeding.
We simulate SNe Ia light curves with the Mocksurveya package based on a wCDM model with
w = −1, following the redshift distribution of the three surveys. The number of SNe Ia simu-
lated are 1841 for ZTF; 886 for SNLS; and 659 for HST, reaching quantities equivalent to the
Lemaˆıtre combination. The simulated bandpasses are generated with the Bandpassesb package.
To calibrate an instrument, one effective method is to observe an on-sky reference like a CAL-
SPEC standard star, which is assumed to be accurate. By comparing the expected integrated
flux of the spectrum over the filter bandpass with the measured flux, we can determine an offset
calibration term for each filter, known as zero points. They serve as reference values, anchoring
our measurements to a photometric system reference, such as the CALSPEC calibration.
To investigate the influence of different CALSPEC releases on the filter transmissions of our
surveys, we simulate the observation of the 2024 CALSPEC release of G191B2B by integrating
the Lemaˆıtre survey filter transmissions. This simulation is repeated for the 2013 release, and
we compute the flux difference for each filter of each survey using the two CALSPEC releases.
The differences quantify the calibration bias from using one release over the other. To examine
the impact of this calibration bias on the fit of cosmological parameters, we add the flux bias
to the corresponding zero point value for each filter, producing a biased dataset of SNe Ia
simulations. This keeps the observed flux constant while altering only the zero points used to
fit the cosmological parameters.
We then generate a Hubble diagram by fitting the distance moduli µ of each SN with
SNCosmoc. Figure 1 shows the residual plot to the simulated cosmology, revealing significant
scatter and an important bias for the SNLS survey. This analysis underlines that a miscali-

red and black dashed lines represent how a deviation of w of respectively 3 % and 10 % impacts the distance
moduli µ. The colored surfaces represent an approximate visualization of the redshifts ranges of each survey.
bration of approximately 10 mmag on µ can lead to a bias exceeding 3 % in the constraint of
w. Consequently, achieving a 1 mmag accuracy in the measurement of CALSPEC standards is
crucial to reach w accuracy below 3 %, aligning with the precision goals of modern cosmology.

StarDICE experiment
An approach to meet this requirement involves directly measuring the absolute flux of CAL-
SPEC spectra without relying on prior numerical models. This is achieved by transferring the
calibration from laboratory standards to observations of CALSPEC standards, as discussed in
Section 6 of Bohlin et al. 20141.
The StarDICE experiment proposes a metrology chain from laboratory flux references toward
the measurement of standard star spectra. This calibration transfer is schematized in Figure 3,
and goes as follows: (1) is operated by the NIST (Houston et al.
20083) and results in a
silicon photodiode calibrated against the POWRd facility; (2) is achieved with the StarDICE
sensor calibration bench (Betoule et al. 20234); (3) consists of the calibration of a StarDICE
artificial star with the previously calibrated StarDICE camera; (4) is the recalibration of the
CALSPEC standard stars with the calibrated StarDICE telescope (Souverin et al. 2024 in
prep.); (5) is performed by the survey itself, observing standard stars to calibrate its instrument.
The StarDICE photometric instrument is a Newton telescope hosted l’Observatoire de
Haute-Provence, observing in the ugrizy photometric system.
It has been operational since
early 2023, currently undergoing a pre-survey phase focused on testing observing strategies.
Since September 2023, it has cumulated around 30 nights of observations. During this phase,
the priority has been given to observing CALSPEC primary standards when they are visible,
and secondary standards otherwise, with several targets observed each night. A first photomet-
ric analysis have been pursued to evaluate the StarDICE performance to refine the CALSPEC
calibration, for every ugrizy filter. We have analyzed a total of 9 observation nights of G191B2B,
and studied the accuracy at which StarDICE can measure the zero point of each filter.
The results are depicted in Figure 4, showing the Root Mean Square of the zero point
measurement for each filter, normalized by the square root of the observation nights Nnights.
With Nnights = 9, the StarDICE experiment demonstrates the ability to refine the CALSPEC
calibration to a dispersion of about 1 % for the griz bands. Scaling this performance to a 2-year

survey, equivalent to ∼80 observation nights, we estimate achieving a dispersion of 0.2 % to
0.4 % for the griz bands. This precision is roughly two to four times higher than the target
needed to reduce the systematic bias on the w determination to less than 3 %.
Significant improvements are expected for the StarDICE experiment in the coming years,
which will hopefully reduce the zero point dispersion. These enhancements include the instal-
lation of an artificial star to continuously monitor telescope calibration, an infrared camera to
track cloud-induced extinction, and the implementation of spectrophotometric analysis for more
accurate atmospheric contribution estimations.
